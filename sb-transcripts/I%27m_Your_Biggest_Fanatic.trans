[SpongeBob and Patrick are at the Jellyfish Convention, where everything is about jellyfish. SpongeBob is wearing a jellyfish hat and Patrick is wearing a net on his head]
SpongeBob: Wow! I can't believe it! We're actually here at the biannual Jellyfish Convention!
Patrick: Jellyfish are awesome!
SpongeBob: Cool! State-of-the-art jellyfish nets!
Patrick: [touches one of the nets] Touch.
Guard: Don't touch.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Patrick walk up to a giant harpoon with gobs of jelly on it] Wow! The harpoon from "Jellyfish: The Movie!"
Patrick: [touches it] Touch.
Guard: Don't touch!
SpongeBob: [he and Patrick walk up to a crowd, watching a fish with a giant sore on his cheek pointing to a board with a mean jellyfish picture on it] Look! Dr. Manowar! The guy who got stung by Big Lenny and lived!
Dr. Manowar: [Talking in a microphone] And now it only hurts when you touch it. [Patrick goes up and touches his sore. Manowar screams in pain]
Patrick: Touch.
Guard: Do I have to follow you all day?!
SpongeBob: Oh! Patrick, look! Can it be?
Patrick: Ice cream?
SpongeBob: No, it's the Jellyspotters! [we see a crowd of people around a group of fish and a sea cucumber, obviously the leader. He has glasses and a crown thing coming from his head] Bikini Bottom's premier jellyfish enthusiast club! Ah! And their leader! The coolest jellyfish enthusiast ever! [camera pans up from the cucumber's feet to his face] Kevin the Sea Cucumber!
Patrick: What's so great about a nerdy pickle?
SpongeBob: If I could just touch the hem of his pocket protector, then maybe some of his greatness would rub off on me.
Patrick: SpongeBob, as a friend, I must say that's really geeky. [a guy in a giant jellyfish costume walks by. Patrick gasps] Oh my gosh! Jeffrey Jellyfish! Wait, Jeffrey! I have to touch you! [runs after him, followed by the guard yelling.]
Guard: Hey! [Chases Patrick, cut back to the Jellyspotters]
Kevin: Bamboo? I only use composite materials in my net handle. [the crowd writes notes]
Crowd: [all muttering as they write] Composite materials?
Kevin: Next question. [the crowd writes notes again]
Crowd: [all muttering again] Next question?
SpongeBob: [pops out in front of the crowd, his pupils are huge and he speaks as if in a trance] Hi, Kevin.
Kevin: Hi. What is your question?
SpongeBob: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin: Whatever. Next question, please. [he points to the other side of the crowd, SpongeBob pops up there, too]
SpongeBob: Hi, Kevin.
Kevin: Hello, loser. All right, you, way in the back.
SpongeBob: [pops up way in the back] Hi, Kevin.
Kevin: Does anyone here have an actual-? [we hear SpongeBob heavily breathing from the left. Kevin and the rest turn to see him]
SpongeBob: Hi, Kevin. I'm your biggest fan.
Kevin: You're too kind. [yells] Security!
SpongeBob: No, wait! I would do anything for you!
Kevin: Why don't you go jump off a building? [we hear SpongeBob's scream and see him fall from the view through the window. Then SpongeBob appears back in the building]
SpongeBob: Anything!
Kevin: Punch yourself in the face. [SpongeBob does so with a boxing glove. His face is pushed in a bit] Doesn't that hurt you?
SpongeBob: [holds up a metal glove with spiked knuckles] Do you want it to hurt me, Kevin? [Kevin and the Jellyspotters all laugh]
Kevin: That was the best! [continue laughing] This guy's great! We have got to bring this guy jellyfishing with us!
Anchovy Jellyspotter: No, Kevin, no. He's a geek.
Kevin: [whispering] Look, I won't let the guy join the club. I just want to see how many times he can get stung before he goes running home like a baby.
Anchovy Jellyspotter: Meep-meep, Kevin's a genius. [the other anchovies Jellyspotters join in repeatedly saying so]
Kevin: Hey, kid. how would you like to try out for the Jellyspotters?
[SpongeBob is on a hospital bed.]
Doctor: Clear.
SpongeBob: [The doctor fish zaps him with the defibrillator and SpongeBob jumps up] I'd love it! [cut to Kevin and the fish supposedly walking through Jellyfish Fields] [off-screen with their legs]
Kevin: Ah, nothing like driving through Jellyfish Fields with the top down, eh, Jellyspotters? [the Jellyspotters meep in agreement. Pan down to see that SpongeBob is carrying them. He stops]
SpongeBob: [breathes out] Uh... here we are, Jellyfish Fields. Ohh... [he collapses. The Jellyspotters get off]
Kevin: I hope you didn't forget our nets.
SpongeBob: I didn't forget them, Kevin. They're in the trunk. [SpongeBob turns around, and the back of his pants opens like a trunk. The group takes the nets and jars out, revealing SpongeBob's buttocks. SpongeBob now has all the nets and jars in his arms] I can't believe I'm actually out here with the Jellyspotters! I mean all my life I wanted to be a Jellyspotter... [SpongeBob starts to vibrate and jump around] ...and now I'm out here with you guys with the nets and the jars and the jellyfish and I'm with Kevin and Kevin's with me and we're all with each other and we're all jellyfishing and it's fun and-
Kevin: Hold it! [SpongeBob freezes, literally] Before you become a Jellyspotter, you have to pass a rigorous test.
Jellyspotters: [laughing] Meep! Rigorous test! [continuing laughing]
Kevin: [To the Jellyspotters] Quiet!, Shh! [To SpongeBob] Your first test: catch a jellyfish. [a jellyfish flies into SpongeBob's net]
SpongeBob: Hey, I caught one! Am I a Jellyspotter now?
Jellyspotters: Meep, he caught one. ["Meep" discussions]
Kevin: Uh, that doesn't count. [he slaps the net and the jellyfish flies out and stings the side of his head] Ouch! [The jellyfish flies away. Kevin grows a giant red sore where he got stung.]
Anchovy Jellyspotter: [off-screen in ominous voice] Wah-wah-waaaaah!
Kevin: I meant two jellyfish! [two jellyfish immediately fly in SpongeBob's net]
Jellyspotters: Two jellyfish, meep, in the net. ["Meep" discussions]
Kevin: Th-That's not what I meant! I meant 20 jellyfish! [18 more jellyfish immediately fly into SpongeBob's net]
SpongeBob: [counting] Oh, Uh, let's see, one, two, three? [Kevin growls and kicks the net, causing all 20 jellyfish to sting him in a blaze of electricity.]
Kevin: Ooh-ooh-ow! Ooh! Ow! [The jellyfish fly off, leaving Kevin with a bunch of sores all over his body]
Anchovy Jellyspotter: [off-screen in ominous voice] Wah-wah-waaaaah! [cut to the fields, where Kevin has a jar of jelly]
Kevin: Jellyspotters allow jellyfish to eat jelly off their face. [Kevin smears some jelly on the lower half SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: Who wants to lick my cheeks? [some jellyfish swim by] I see I have some takers!
Kevin: How does it feel?
SpongeBob:  [sporting a huge jellyfish mustache and beard. He laughs] It tickles my nose!
Kevin: Not for long. [he and the Jellyspotters snicker. SpongeBob sneezes, firing the entire swarm of jellyfish onto Kevin's eyes. They sting them and now he has big red swollen eyes]
Anchovy Jellyspotter: Wah-wah-waaaaah!
Kevin: [turns to the fish making that taunting noise] Will you cut that out?!
SpongeBob: Am I in the Jellyspotters now?
Kevin: No! But I have many more tests for you to take! [cut to SpongeBob walking upside-down, with a net and a jellyfish]
SpongeBob: Am I in the Jellyspotters now? [the jellyfish stings Kevin's nose, making it big and swollen]
Kevin: No. [cut to SpongeBob having caught a jellyfish blindfolded]
SpongeBob: Am I in the Jellyspotters now? [the jellyfish stings Kevin's crown and it becomes swollen, into some broccoli-shaped blister]
Kevin: No. [cut to just SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Now? [we hear zapping sounds. Now Kevin's ears are big and swollen]
Kevin: No. [cut to just SpongeBob again]
SpongeBob: Now? [more zapping noises. Kevin's lips are now huge and swollen]
Kevin: No. [cut to Sponge once more]
SpongeBob: Now? [Jellyfish zaps Kevin. Kevin's butt is now huge and swollen]
Kevin: [screaming] NO!
SpongeBob: Now? [Jellyfish zaps Kevin] Now? [Jellyfish zaps Kevin] Now? [now, Kevin is just a big swollen sea cucumber thing]
Kevin: Okay, SquarePants, it is your turn to get zapped! I mean... are you ready for your final test?
SpongeBob: I'm ready!
Kevin: You'd better be, because we're going to capture a queen jellyfish.
SpongeBob: A queen? Can I help?
Kevin: Oh, don't worry. We can't do it without you! [cut to SpongeBob being tied by arms and legs, hanging from two sticks]
SpongeBob: This is fantastic! I've never been bait before! I don't think I've ever seen a queen jellyfish either.
Kevin: Well, then you've probably never used a queen jellyfish call. Why don't you try it out? [he hands him a blower thing. SpongeBob blows and it makes a weird groaning sound that sort of sounds like, "Loser."]
SpongeBob: Hey, I've heard this call before.
Kevin: I'll bet you have. [the Jellyspotters walk off]
SpongeBob: Hey, where are you going?
Kevin: Oh, don't worry, we'll be right behind this bush. [they kneel down behind it. Kevin gets zapped again. He stands up covered in sores, a jellyfish flies off] Who's got my sting ointment? [he kneels down again]
SpongeBob: This is great! When I pass this test, I'll be an official jellyfish spotter! [he continues to blow that horn thing, which keeps saying, "Loser." Soon, it becomes dark and he's tired of blowing] Hey, Kevin. I don't think it's working. Nothing. [a giant shadow looms over SpongeBob. He looks up, to find a giant jellyfish with a tiara.] Hey, hey, Kevin! She's here! Look, she's here! She's here, Kevin! She... [the bush blows away, revealing nothing, except Kevin's ointment. SpongeBob screams and the jellyfish zaps the poles off. SpongeBob runs up and down hills, dodging the jellyfish's stingers. He comes upon a cliff and can't go any further. He begs on his hands and knees] Please don't be angry, your highness! I would have let you go! [cries. Just then, a screen on the jellyfish opens, revealing Kevin and the Jellyspotters, controlling the machine from the inside. They laugh. SpongeBob gasps] Kevin!
Kevin: That's right! You should have seen the look on your face when we zapped you!
SpongeBob: But... What about my final test? [they all laugh]
Kevin: Did you think we'd actually let you into the Jellyspotters?
SpongeBob: But, Kevin, I was your biggest fan!
Kevin: So were they. [he points to the bottom of the cliff, where a bunch of people are by a fire. One looks up]
Guy: Hey, look, everybody. Kevin's back! [they all yell up at him in praise]
Kevin: You looked so dumb with your dorky jellyfish call! [He and the Jellyspotters imitating] Loser, loser, loser loser loser! [SpongeBob blushes and sadly frowns]
SpongeBob: I am not a loser!
Kevin: Loooooser! [as Kevin continues saying "loser," a giant, even bigger than the queen, jellyfish comes from the cliff. It is wearing a robe and a crown.] Ah-ha-ha-ha! [The Jellyspotters finally notice] Cnidaria rex!
SpongeBob: King Jellyfish! [the king sees the queen and is instantly smitten. It grows lips and puckers up]
Kevin: Kissy face! [the queen and SpongeBob run off. The king gives a chase. The queen eventually crashes into a billboard for Kevin's Ointment and breaks apart.]
Jellyfish King: Huh? [The king sees Kevin, the Jellyspotters, and SpongeBob. Record scratch sound effect. Kevin quivers.] [angrily] Keeeee-viiiiin! [it zaps the ground and they all run off. They find refuge in a cave. The king jellyfish comes back with a helmet and football uniform and attempts to bash in the cave. Inside, the Jellyspotters and SpongeBob are pretty scared. The bashing stops]
Kevin: I think he's gone. One of you, go out and check. [the Jellyspotters push one fish out of the cave to see. The anchovy Jellyspotter looks around and "meep-meep"s happily, giving the all-clear. He soon gets zapped and "meep-meep"s not to come out. All the Jellyspotters go around Kevin asking what to do] 
Jellyspotters: Meep! Save us! Meep Kevin, save us! [more meep begging]
Kevin: Don't look at me! I was just in this for the fashion! [close up on Kevin's pants, with patches, stickers and a toy jellyfish coming out of his pocket] It's hopeless! We're trapped! We're trapped! [he sits down and curls to a ball] Help me, mommy! Help me! I want my blankie! I want my blankie!
SpongeBob: [to the fish] Now what do we do? [the Jellyspotters get down and imitate Kevin. SpongeBob decides enough is enough and goes out to face the king. The king growls and buzzes. SpongeBob takes out a bottle of bubble mix in response.]
Jellyfish King: What the? [SpongeBob inhales and blows a bubble in the shape of a giant cherry pie. The king, satisfied, leaves to eat his snack.] Hmm? Mm, mm, mm! Yummy! [The jellyspotters come out and gather around SpongeBob. Other jellyspotters "meep" happily. Kevin follows]
Kevin: I can't believe it! How did you know?
SpongeBob: [laughs] Everybody loves pie!
Anchovy Jellyspotter: [ominous voice] Wah-wah-waaaaah!
Kevin: Well, SquarePants, that was impressive, but you're still not in the club because you didn't catch a queen jellyfish. [the other Jellyspotters narrow their eyes and run over to Kevin, off-screen] Wait, what are you doing? [rip] Aaah! [the fish run back with Kevin's crown and place it on SpongeBob. He laughs]
SpongeBob: Wow, I didn't know this was a hat!
Kevin: [teary-eyed; with a torn part where his "crown" used to be] It wasn't...
[cut to back at the convention. SpongeBob talks to Patrick]
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick!
Patrick: Hi, SpongeBob! Did you get into that club?
SpongeBob: Yeah, but I turned them down. It's not about Kevin, it's about jellyfish!
Patrick: Well, SpongeBob, I'm glad you learned your lesson. [pan out to see that Patrick has Jeffrey Jellyfish tied up in a wagon he's towing] Hero worship is unhealthy. [the two walk off] C'mon, Jeffrey.
