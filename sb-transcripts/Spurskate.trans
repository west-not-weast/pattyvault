SpongeBuck: Isn't this fun?
Pecos: Yeah, and anyone can do it, even me.
Announcer: The Spurskate is great for anyone! You can freestyle Spurskate! [Hopalong is shown sawing through the floor] Or go extreme Spurskate!
[SpongeBuck jumps over four seahorses with flaming cactuses and breaks his legs]
Announcer: Hehe, it's up to you, so stop that walking. [Fish #2 gets run over by SpongeBuck] 'Cause the world is passing you by on Spurskates.
Fish #2: Wow, what are those?
Announcer: They're Spurskates, so join the rest and be your Spurskate best.
Crowd: With Spurskates!
