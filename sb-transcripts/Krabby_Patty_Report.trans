[Dave is shown overweight. Loud sound of cow is heard.]
Perch Perkins: But just who are the people fueling this fab?
SpongeBob: Me! My name is SpongeBob!
Patrick: I also have a name!
Perch Perkins: Uh, yes, well, thanks for that I guess. But we're not doing interviews yet. [pushes SpongeBob and Patrick away] This is just a teaser.
Patrick: Teasing isn't nice.
SpongeBob: I thought you wanted to talk to people about frozen Krabby Patties.
Perch Perkins: Okay then. Why do you like them so much? Is it the taste?
Patrick: No. I love 'em 'cause they're popular.
[Patrick shows his Krabby Patty tattoo on his back.]
SpongeBob: [holds out a Krabby Patty] Here, friend. Join the movement.
Perch Perkins: Hmm. [takes the Krabby Patty and eats it] Yes! [swallows it] I finally feel like I'm part of something!
[Perch eats the Krabby Patty then takes another out of Patrick's box.]
Perch Perkins: I belong!
Patrick: Hey, that was mine!
Perch Perkins: Oh, I'm sorry. Let me just-yoink!
[Perch takes another Krabby Patty and eats it. Perch runs off and Patrick chases him.]
Patrick: Fine!
[Perch and Patrick chase as they snatch the Krabby Patties from Sandals and Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs puts the "No Refunds" sign on his stand. Perch and Patrick continue to chase as they gobble up every Krabby Patty the customers got. The customers form an angry mob and chase after Perch.]
Crowd: That's mine!
Perch Perkins: I'm in with the in-crowd! [laughs crazily]
[Perch continues to run across Bikini Bottom with Patrick and the angry mob chasing him. SpongeBob attempts to follow but is out of breath.]
