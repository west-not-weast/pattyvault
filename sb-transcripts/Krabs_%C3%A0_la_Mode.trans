Narrator: It is a cold and windy day, and Bikini Bottom is covered with goosebumps.
Squidward: Oh, it's freezing in here!
SpongeBob: Not if you get up and exercise! Hut, two. Hut, two. Yes, sir. My buns are nice and toasty. [turns around to show two Krabby Patties on his butt]
Squidward: I'm so glad I don't eat here. [SpongeBob, Squidward, and the Krabby Patties shiver as a gusty wind blows through again] Oh, how cold does Krabs keep this place, anyway? [looks at the thermostat to show 62°] 62 degrees?! Oh, that cheapskate! I'm going to set it to a toasty 63. [turns it to 63° but an alarm goes off] Huh?
Mr. Krabs: [hears alarm, bursts down his door] WHO TOUCHED ME THERMOSTAT?!?!?! [everyone, including SpongeBob points at Squidward]
Squidward: [at SpongeBob] Oh, thanks a-- [Mr. Krabs grabs him by the nose]
SpongeBob: You're welcome, Squidward.
Mr. Krabs: Mr. Squidward, you're always going on about your book club. Read this.
Squidward: [reads sign above thermostat] "Do not touch thermostat ever." [Mr. Krabs puts the temperature back on 62°]
Mr. Krabs: Heat costs money! There are two ways to get on my bad side, boys. I don't like kids playing in me yard, and nobody but me touches me thermostat!
Squidward: That's totally selfish!
SpongeBob: Yeah! Your yard is really fun! There are kids playing on it right now!
Mr. Krabs: What?! [kids are playing ball, flying kites and jumping rope in Mr. Krabs front yard] Hey, you kids get off of my lawn! [Mr. Krabs runs out of the restaurant. Plankton is watching all of this through a straw]
Plankton: That's right. Run, Krabs. For I have found your Achilles heel. I'll freeze you out of business and I'll do it with your precious thermostat! [laughs maniacally until an alarm goes off] What the--? Oh, no! Code red! Abandon ship! Abandon ship! [Plankton screams as Old Man Jenkins sucks him through the straw and into his belly] No matter. In four to six hours, I will have my revenge. [laughs manically]
[Mr. Krabs flips the sign to CLOSED, which means closing time after their work day. SpongeBob and Squidward wait as Mr. Krabs locks the doors]
Squidward: I'm going to go recover from hypothermia.
SpongeBob: Hippo what-ia? What does that mean?
Mr. Krabs: It means he's a big fat crybaby.
Old Man Jenkins: [flushes the toilet and walks to the doors but can't get out] Locked in again.
Plankton: That crusty old barnacle might keep me from the secret formula, but I'd like to see him serve a Krabby Patty when I'm done with this place. [turns on sink faucet] Into every life, a little rain must fall, Krabs! It's just business. [opens up the freezer] Well, maybe it is personal. [turns down the thermostat to –15°] I'm touching your thermostat! I'm touching your thermostat! [cut to Mr. Krabs house where he is sleeping]
Mr. Krabs: Someone—touching—thermostat. [cut to next day with Squidward and SpongeBob walking to work]
Squidward: I might need to bring a sweater. It's colder than yesterday.
