SpongeBob: Go long. [throws a green frisbee in the air and then chases after it himself, a fish drinking juice watches SpongeBob run by him but then the frisbee hits him in the head, causing his juice to spill on the sand, SpongeBob catches the frisbee] Gotcha.
Fish: You spilled my juice! [cries]
SpongeBob: [gasps] Aw, don't cry, you little dickens. [uses his toes to wipe off the tears, as he gets a tear, his toe enlarges, the fish gets an idea] Tu-jh-Tu-jh. You're in good hands. [sucks up the juice on the ground and then extracts it into his cup] There you are, darling. Lots of vitamins in there. [a group of fish walk up]
Fish #2: Look you, guys, Jimmy's hanging out with Juiceman.
