[SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting in a time machine]
SpongeBob: [as his face changes triumphantly] Patrick, with this time machine, we can go back in time, and see Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy in their prime as young super heroes!
Patrick: [his eyes bulge] Go! Go! Go! [rips off SpongeBob's arm and presses the go button with it, sending them to a time seeing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy as British-like elders riding high bikes]
SpongeBob: Eh, no. [presses the go button with two hands, sending him and Patrick to a time seeing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy as cavemen, riding a Tyrannosaurus Rex fish] Too far. [uses three hands to press the go button, sending him and Patrick to a time seeing Mermaid Man as a robot with one of his hands as Barnacle Boy, twisting him] Oops! Wrong way! [Patrick uses his head to press the go button, sending him and SpongeBob to a time seeing Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy as babies]
Baby Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy: [wailing] Change our diapers!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [screaming] Ahh!
Fish Head: [a question mark is shown up] Will they get it right? Will SpongeBob and Patrick get to see their super heroes in their super prime?
