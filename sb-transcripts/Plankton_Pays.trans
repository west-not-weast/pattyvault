SpongeBob: [comes out from behind a rock] Oh, hello. Welcome to the Bikini Bottom Jellyfish Trauma Center. Let's go inside. [smashes into the door] Ow!
Patient: Ow! Ow! Ow! It burns.
SpongeBob: [walks past patients with various injuries] These poor souls are here because they found themselves for the wrong side of a jellyfish stinger. Not if they're the right side. [laughs] The point is, that we will all be respectful...
Plankton: Ouch!
SpongeBob: Bah! Stepped on a pickle.
Plankton: Pickle?! I'm not a pickle, you... [SpongeBob picks up Plankton] Whoa! Careful, oaf!
SpongeBob: Ow, that pickle's Plankton. What happened to you?
Plankton: This is the Jellyfish Trauma Center, dunce. What do you think hapâ€”
SpongeBob: Aw, you poor thing, have some flowers.
Plankton: [screams] I'm allergic to Chrysanthemums! [turns red]
SpongeBob: Nurse! This hot dog needs help!
Patrick: [comes in dressed like a nurse] I'm on it.
SpongeBob: Patrick, what are you doing here?
Patrick: [starts filling Plankton with air] Community service. It's a long story.
Plankton: Um, I could use a little help here. [opens door and floats away into the air] Well, at least I'm safe from those savages. [shows one jellyfish] Err, gah. Ohhh! [shows all the jellyfishes] Oh, mommy. Not the eye! [the jellyfish sting him and he screams]
SpongeBob: I think we've all learned something here for today. Thanks for watching.
