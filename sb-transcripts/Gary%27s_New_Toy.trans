'[SpongeBob's alarm sounds, but then it starts to cough and snaps in two. SpongeBob picks it up]
SpongeBob: Hmm. Gary, have you been chewing on my alarm clock again? Oh, well. [Tries to fix it with tape but it falls over again] Up and at 'em. [Jumps out of bed] Eww. Gary, not my slippers, too! Huh, Nasty. [Goes into the bathroom and smells his breath] Eurgh. Oral hygiene to the rescue! [Reaches into the cabinet for his toothbrush, but Gary is chewing it] What the hey? Come on, Gary! [Pulls] Let go! [Tickles him] Coochie coochie coo! [Gary laughs and lets go] Golly, Gary, what's gotten into you? Are you bored? I'll play with you later. [Gary chews the toothpaste tube] Gary! [SpongeBob drops him into the bath] Gary, you are a nut. Sheesh!
Gary: [Chews on a bar of soap] Meow. [Cut to SpongeBob at the kitchen table making breakfast]
SpongeBob: [Pours cereal] That snail sure is acting weird. It's like he's teething again. [Pours milk, but it leaks out of the bowl, looks through a hole in it] Hey, hold on a second...Gary, have you been chewing on my bowl?!
Gary: [Spits a piece of bowl out] Noew.
SpongeBob: [Gary chews the table] Gary, are you trying to tell me something? Could it be that what you need is a new chew toy? [Gary licks him] I thought so. [Gary chews his nose] [Cut to the pet store]
SpongeBob: Ooh, I bet they have lots of toys here. Hey, look, there's Patrick! Howdy, Patrick.
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob, Gareth.
SpongeBob: What are you doing here? You don't have a pet.
Patrick: Confidentially, I'm just here for the free samples. [Punches a hole in a bag of worm food and eats some] Mmm, you can really taste the gourmet. [To the picture of the mascot] Oh, thank you, ma'am, I may consider purchasing this brand for my worms. [To SpongeBob] Want some?
SpongeBob: No thanks, just had breakfast. We're here to buy Gary a new toy.
Patrick: They're on aisle 3, next to the most delicious snail treats. Follow me! [Takes one last handful of worm food then leads SpongeBob and Gary to aisle 3] Here they are! Tasty Time snail treats. [Eats one]
SpongeBob: Well, how about this one? [Gives Gary a bone shaped toy. Gary bites it and it deflates.] Okay, how about this? Well? [Gives Gary a fire hydrant toy. He squeezes it and squirts water in SpongeBob's face.] Yeah, I don't think so.
Patrick: Hey, guys, check this out! (Points to a machine) A Pet Point 3000!
SpongeBob: A pet toy that plays with your pet! What do you think, Gary?
Gary: Meh. (Slithers away, uninterested)
Patrick: It's so futuristic. (Presses a button and a laser pointer appears) Look, a red dot! (He chases it) Come back here!
SpongeBob: That's brilliant! What will they think of next?
Patrick: I love this thing! Let's turn it up! (He does so) Huh? (The laser points at his head and starts to burn a hole) Where did it go?
SpongeBob: (Pointing) Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: Huh? Oh, there it is. Hey, do you smell something burning? (The laser burns right through his head. SpongeBob turns it off. Patrick's brain falls out of the hole and into SpongeBob. SpongeBob blows it out of his nose and puts it back into Patrick's head.)
SpongeBob: Here, you might need this. You know, I'm not sure that toy is safe for Gary. Where is Gary, anyway? Gary? (Gary spots a small red ball on top of a pile and slithers up to it. He licks it and then bites it.)
SpongeBob: Gary? Gary! (Gary drops the ball and SpongeBob picks it up) Hey, where'd you come from? I wonder if Gary would like this ball. Ga- (Gary falls on top of him and licks the ball) I guess you do. (Cut to SpongeBob and Gary arriving home)
SpongeBob: Are you ready to play with your new ball? (Takes it out of the bag) Here it is, boy! 
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: You want it, boy?
Gary: Meow!
SpongeBob: OK, boy, go and get it! Go and get it! Go and get it! Fetch! (Throws it)
Gary: Meow. (Chases it into the kitchen) 
SpongeBob: OK, Gary, bring it back! (Hears squeaking) C'mon, Gary, bring it back. (Goes into the kitchen and sees Gary chewing the ball) You're supposed to bring it … back …(Gary sees SpongeBob staring and moves underneath the table, chewing the ball excessively) Ah well, as long as he's not chewing on my stuff.  (Cut to SpongeBob waching TV. He turns it off.) I wonder how Gary's doing? I haven't heard a squeak out of him. (Looks in the kitchen) Gary? Hmm, where is that snail? Gary, where are you? (Looks in another room) Gary, I- oh, there you are! (Sees Gary having a tea party with the ball) Oh, a tea party, cute! Do you mind if I join you? I just love a spot of tea. (Sits down) What kind of tea is it? Green tea? Earl gray? Oolong? Slippery elm? (Gary puts the ball in a baby carriage and leaves) Gee, I think he likes that ball more than me. (Takes a sip of “tea” then spits it out in disgust) Deugh! That is not tea.
(Cut to SpongeBob walking into the kitchen. He takes a can a snail food out of the cupboard.)
SpongeBob: I know what will get Gary's attention. Good old Slimycan! (Opens the can slowly, checking to see if Gary hears and comes running) Here you go, Ga- (Notices that Gary isn't there and lets the food slide onto the floor) Darn it, Gary.
(Cut to SpongeBob looking for Gary with his food in a bowl.)
SpongeBob: Gary, dinner time! Gary! (Opens the garage door) Gary? (Gary turns around to reveal that he has painted his face red with lipstick to match the ball) OK, that's just creepy. Gary, I think you need to spend some time away from this ball. (Gary presses the garage door button and SpongeBob gets lifted to the ceiling) This isn't helping your case. (Gary grabs the ball and leaves)
(Cut to Gary sleeping. SpongeBob walks in.)
