Balloons
-1
[SpongeBob leaps into the middle of his living room and begins exhaling a large pink balloon. It floats into the air, then he exhales a green balloon into the air and then a blue balloon into the air, a picture of his lungs gasping and wheezing, cut to SpongeBob's lungs being exhaled, on the floor, from so much blowing out of the mouth]
SpongeBob: Hmmm, maybe I could use some help blowing up these balloons. [cut to SpongeBob jumping on Patrick's stomach, which blows a purple balloon up from Patrick's mouth, cut to SpongeBob trying to put a balloon on Sandy's air helmet, which does not amuse her] Say, Gary, I was wondering if... [Gary screeches, jumps out of his shell and runs out the door on his eyes, SpongeBob notices the phone by a picture of Squidward] Hmmm... the hotline. [line ringing] Hey-hey, Squid, old buddy.
Squidward: [on phone] SpongeBob, I told you to stop calling me! [continues angrily as SpongeBob places a green balloon on the east side of the phone, it blows up while Squidward is still talking]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, you are a such a card. [cackling while putting more balloons on the phone to be blown up, pan out to see a bunch of balloons already on the floor and ceiling]
