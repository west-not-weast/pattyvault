SpongeBob: The Story of [SpongeBob's pants pull down] King Neptune. [switches to story] When King Neptune was a little Neptune, his mother sent him adrift in a river. As he floated along, a giant meteor fell on Earth. An alien appeared, and inflicted the baby with Super Neptune Fluid. [alien squirts King Neptune] By the time he was in school, he had already begun exhibiting signs of super-duperness. As an adult, he would fly through the sea, helping people, and getting snails off of sea-trees. [King Neptune gives snail to an elderly fish]
Patrick: [interrupts] Is that really the [switches to SpongeBob in Patrick's room, Patrick is in bed] origin of King Neptune?
SpongeBob: Sure. [as he says "sure," he puts a comic book behind his back]
