Squidward: [Starts with showing SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward's houses] It's finally complete! [shows Squidward in his house at a table] After weeks and weeks of burning the candle at both ends, [voice calms down] literally, [a double-sided, burned candle is shown, and his voice returns in a louder tone] my first clarinet concerto is complete and ready to be performed! [Squidward falls at a quake, and his clarinet concerto papers fall in the fire of the double-sided candle] NO! [Squidward is quaked again] Now, I'm flummoxed. [Squidward opens his front door, and he hits his head four times as he yells "Doh, doh, doh, doh"] Drggh. [SpongeBob and Patrick are shown hammering a "For Rent" sign]
SpongeBob: Hit it one more time Patrick. Don't want anyone stealing it. [Patrick hammers the sign into the ground, and it is destroyed to pieces] Perfect [SpongeBob claps his hands.]
SpongeBob: Good Job Patrick.
Squidward: Drrrrrgh! All right, what's going on out here? I can't even hear myself think!
Patrick: [Raises his hand] Oh! Ooh! Can you smell yourself think?
Squidward: [Calmly] No. [raises his voice] As I was saying, you two... [Patrick interrupts]
Patrick: Or see?
Squidward: No!
Patrick: [screams] How, how about taste? Can you taste yourself think?
Squidward: Shut it! What are you two dingbats doing?
SpongeBob: We were just posting Patrick's new "For Rent" sign. Did we work on it all morning, see? [the sign is shown]
Squidward: For rent? You mean one of you is moving out?
SpongeBob: [laughs] No, Patrick here is just gonna rent out his front yard.
Patrick: Need a little extra cash if you know what I mean?
Squidward: Wow! To think this day started off so horribly and now... What do you mean you're just gonna rent out your front yard?
Patrick: First come, first, serve.
Squidward: Oh great, now another idiot can move in.
SpongeBob: Oh Squidward, that reminds me. Patrick and I are off to Jellyfish Fields for the day. We were wondering if maybe you can stick around and keep an eye out for any takers.
Squidward: Oh I would love to. Just let me check my planner. [takes out his planner and looks in it]
SpongeBob: Oh, thanks!
Squidward: Oh no, I'm sorry I can't.
SpongeBob: Aww, why not?
Squidward: It's because I was planning to do "No such thing"! See?
SpongeBob: Oh, well thanks anyway, Squidward.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. [Bubble transition]
Squidward: With those two bone bags gone, I now have enough time for some peace and... [everything shakes] ...quiet. [walks outside] Now what are those two boobs up to? I thought you guys were... [SpongeBob and Patrick aren't there] Hmmm. I wonder who was making all that noise.
Howard: Hello. My name is Howard.
Squidward: Hello, Howard.
Howard: I noticed this "For Rent" sign. Is this yard still for rent?
Squidward: Sorry, you're too late.
Howard: Hmmm. Howard is disappointed.
Squidward: Aren't we all?
Howard: I thought this would be the one place to pursue my passions...
Squidward: [peeks out door] Passions?
Howard: ...play the bassoon...
Squidward: The bassoon?
Howard: ...and enjoy a nice cup of tea in my front yard.
Squidward: [speaks gibberish] I can't believe what I am hearing. [sighs] Finally, a neighbor that has it! I can only imagine! Painting portraits while sipping tea, recumbent bicycling into a museum, and performing a duet at the Bikini Bottom concert! [sighs again]
Howard: [leaving] Farewell. I new this was too good to be true.
Squidward: [stops him] Wait! Don't go!' '[panting] I was...just kidding!
Howard: Well, in that case, I should move in right away! [invites Squidward] Make yourself at home.
Squidward: Wow, his designs are impeccable! [to Howard] Yes, I do feel "at home".
Howard: I would like to propose a toastâ€”to a new neighbor.
Squidward: To a new neighbor! [they both drink tea]
Howard: While we're on the topic, what are the other neighbors like?
Squidward: [nervous] Oh! Well, they're just like any other neighbors.
Howard: That's neat. I'm the neighbor that likes all kinds of neighbors!
Squidward: Well, that's nice!
Howard: Well, as long they aren't jellyfishers. [Squidward nearly chokes on his tea] I can't STAND anyone who jellyfishes. But, luckily, they're not the worst kind of neighbor.
Squidward: Well, that's nice.
Howard: That would be the bubble blowers. [Squid spits out his tea] Between the jellyfishers and the bubble blowers, I just couldn't stand to stay in my old neighborhood anymore.
Squidward: Well, you won't even NOTICE what the neighbors around here are like! [Squid looks out the window. SpongeBob and Patrick return from jellyfishing and notice the trailer]
Patrick: SpongeBob, look! There's a mobile home parked in front of my house!
SpongeBob: Do you know what that means?
