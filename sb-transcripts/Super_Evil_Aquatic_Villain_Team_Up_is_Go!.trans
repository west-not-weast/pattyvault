SpongeBob: [Sings as he walks through the city] Going to work, going to work, I'm going to work! I'm going to work, I'm going to work [spins arms around] I'm going to work! [Twirls] I'm going to work. I'm going to work, going to work, go-going to work. I'm crossing the street! [does so] Crossing the street! I'm crossing the street! Crossing the... [Stops] Wha...? [Hears Plankton crying] I'd recognize that sound anywhere! It's the sound of horrible, croaking sobbing! [Runs over to dark alley]
Plankton: [Tearfully] Oh, Neptune! Why, oh why?!
SpongeBob: Plankton?
Plankton: No, please!  I told you I'd get the money! Please, I- [Stops suddenly and realizes SpongeBob is standing right behind him.] Oh, it's you.
SpongeBob: Plankton, what's got you so upset? I can hear you from three blocks away!
Plankton: Oh, that. It's this doomsday device I invented. [Holds up small device] It just doesn't do what it's supposed to do! 
SpongeBob: Doomsday device? What's it supposed to do?
Plankton: Well, it's supposed to upset the Earth's axis. Causing a chain reaction with typhoons, earthquakes, etc.
SpongeBob: So, what does it do instead?
Plankton: It just sparks and falls apart.
SpongeBob: Sparks and falls apart?
Plankton: You don't believe me?
SpongeBob: [Frantically] N-no!  I believe you! I uh... [Plankton presses button on his device, causing it to spark and smoke and eventually fall apart.] ...believe you.
Plankton: Oh, what's the use?!  Everyday the same old thing. Life is an endless succession of failures and disappointments.
SpongeBob: Well, look on the bright side, Plankton. If all your hopes and dreams finally came true, then you wouldn't have anything left to look forward to.
Plankton: Well, I didn't think I could feel any worse, but at least I know now that anything is possible.
SpongeBob: Plankton, wait! [Holds out arms to stop him]Wait! [Long pause]Wait!
Plankton: I'm waiting!
SpongeBob: Maybe what you need is to join a club or something. Meet new people. You know, make some friends.
Plankton: Hmmm. Yes. Yes. Are you suggesting I form an evil alliance?
SpongeBob: Um, something like that.
Plankton: That is an excellent idea! But where would someone like me find new friends?
SpongeBob: Well, usually when I'm trying to find something, I just look it up in the phone book. [Holds up yellow phone book. Then he gives it to Plankton]
Plankton: [Struggles with phone book in his hands] [Sarcastically] Oh, great. Thanks. [Throws book on the ground and climbs on it.] Let's see here. Aha!  Here we go. [Reads off of phone book] Evil villain for hire. Call Man Ray. No job too diabolical.
SpongeBob: Man Ray? But he's one of Bikini Bottom's most notorious super villains! Arch nemesis of fame television super heroes Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [Gets confused] He's in the phone book? [Plankton laughs] Plankton, you were looking under Fiends not Friends.
Plankton: Oh, I know, SpongeBob. I know. [Tries to hold in his laughter, but he can't and starts laughing again. SpongeBob laughs with him. He then stops and gets confused. Bubble transition to Man Ray in the Bargain Mart putting stuff into vending machines.] Man Ray! We meet at long last! And who would have thought to find here you here, working a part-time job restocking vending machines? That's very clever, Man Ray. Very clever. And now let us join in evil alliance!
