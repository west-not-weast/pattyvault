Rugrats:  Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, Winter Solstice time this year. [Tommy Pickles and Chuckie Finster walk outside and lean on a fence]
Chuckie:  Oh, I think there must be something wrong with me, Thomas.
Tommy: Diaper rash?
Chuckie: Nope. The Christmas Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice are coming but I'm not happy. [both walk away from the fence] I just don't understand Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice, I guess. I like getting presents, sending cards and decorating trees, and spinning dradles, and getting chocolate money, and having harvest feast, and... [the snow has covered them up. Cut to everyone in the play pen inside and dancing like the Peanuts characters]
Angelica: Alright you stupid babies! Chuckie will be here in a second with our decorations. [notices Spike is imitating her and gets mad. Enter Chuckie]
Chuckie: Ok, guys. I gots a tree, a menorah, and corn. But I still gots one question: Isn't there anyone who knows what Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, Winster Solstice is all about?
Tommy: Hey, man, there's no need to yell. Uh, sure, Chuckie Finster, I can tell you. Ahem. Lights please! [spotlight shines on him] And there were, in the same country, people of different backgrounds, beliefs, and cultures. What ho! This shall be unto you a time of joy, peace on Earth, and good will towards peoples.
Angelica: You blockhead! It's about the presents! Lots of presents!
Rugrats:  Happy Christmas, Channukah, Kwaanza, and Winter Solstice, Chuckie Finster!

Mr. Krabs: When I bite into a Dork Krabby Mint Patty, I get the sensation of swimming in money! Piles and piles of it! [takes a bite as money rains down. He laughs. Episode ends.]
