SpongeBob: Jellyfishing Safety Tips. Rule number one: never to feed the jellyfish while jellyfishing.
Patrick: You want some? [bites and stings Patrick and he screams]
SpongeBob: Rule number two: never, ever try to capture a baby jellyfish.
Patrick: Aww, but they're so cute. [a big jellyfish taps Patrick on the shoulder] Oh, hey there, mama jellyfish. [mama jellyfish stings Patrick and he screams]
SpongeBob: [Patrick starts yelling in background as he gets stung by mama jellyfish] Which leads us to our final rule, always carry a thick tube of emergency Jellyfishing Sting Ointment.
Patrick: I think I might need that. [gets stung again and screams]
