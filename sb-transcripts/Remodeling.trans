Plankton: Well, the inside is done and ready for action.
Mr. Krabs: [Puts a yellow flag on the top] Perfect. [giggles]
Billy: You call that a castle? [points to his castle with a movable sand train going in and out] This is a castle.
Mr. Krabs: Wow, that's impressive.
Billy: Duh. Here, let me help you do some remodeling. [jumps on their castle. Krabs and Plankton smile at each other] What are you smiling about?
Plankton: Oh, uh, just this. [a spring from underneath the sand sends the fish flying] Bullies are so predictable.
