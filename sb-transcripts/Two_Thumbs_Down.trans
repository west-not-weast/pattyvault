SpongeBob and Patrick: One, two, three, four...
Patrick: I declare a thumb war! [they both thumb wrestle]
Patrick: Huh?
SpongeBob: Yah!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [laughter]
Patrick: Now that was a great thumb war, mister!
SpongeBob: It was Patrick, but now we will let peace prevail. Let us sign this treaty, and our thumbs will live in harmony.
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they sign the treaty with their thumbs] [start laughing]
SpongeBob: Great job, Patrick! [SpongeBob gives Patrick two thumbs-up, one from each hand]
Patrick: Gee, thanks, SpongeBob. That means a lot!
SpongeBob: Wow, giving someone a thumbs-up feels great!
[cut to the Krusty Krab]
Customer: Boy, these Krabby Patties are delicious.
Other customer: I'll say. They're absolutely stupendous.
SpongeBob: Well, you guys are stupendous customers. [SpongeBob gives the customer two thumbs-up.]
Customer: [gasps] That thumbs-up really touched my heart.
Other customer: Yeah, me too. It's like there's a thumbprint of happiness on my aorta. [heart thumps]
SpongeBob: Flipping.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you shifty sea-slacker, have you counted the cups like I told to do?
SpongeBob: I sure have, Mr. Krabs. Five. But thanks for being on top of the situation. You're a fantastic boss. [SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs one thumbs-up.]
Mr. Krabs: Well, thank you. That's nice of you to say. Now back to work!
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [SpongeBob gives Mr. Krabs one thumbs-up.]
SpongeBob: ... [SpongeBob gives Old lady one thumbs-up]
Squidward: Oh, SpongeBob, do you have one of your precious thumbs-up for me? I would just love to get one. [snickers]
SpongeBob: No, Squidward, I do not have a thumbs-up for you.
SpongeBob: I've got two thumbs-up! [SpongeBob gives Squidward two thumbs-up.]
Squidward: Oh. That's... thank you. I think.
SpongeBob: [whistling] Whoo!
SpongeBob: Hey, Sandy, I'm giving your outfit two thumbs-up. [SpongeBob gives Sandy two thumbs-up.]
Sandy: [giggles] This old thing? It's just something I threw on.
SpongeBob: Well, girl, you really make it work. [SpongeBob gives Sandy one thumbs-up.]
Sandy: Okay.
Driver: Excuse me, I'm trying to find the Goo Lagoon and I'm totally lost.
SpongeBob: Great job on not being afraid to ask for directions. [SpongeBob gives Driver two thumbs-up.]
Driver: Hm... that way? Okay.
SpongeBob: You got the right stuff, golden boys. [SpongeBob kisses his two thumbs-up.]
Sandy: SpongeBob, don't you think that you may be using the thumbs-up just a teensy bit too much?
SpongeBob: Are you kidding? [SpongeBob put his one thumbs-up on Sandy's helmet.]
SpongeBob: The thumbs-up is an iconic, internationally-recognized sign of positivity and affirmation. Boop!
Sandy: Yeah, I know. But when you do it all the time the thumbs-up loses its meaning. It becomes not special.
SpongeBob: Well, I happen to think you can never give too many thumbs-up. [SpongeBob put his many thumbs-up.]
Sandy: I don't know, SpongeBob. I think you should be careful.
SpongeBob: Oh, Sandy, don't be such a worry whale.
SpongeBob: What could do wrong? [SpongeBob put his two thumbs-up.] [humming]
SpongeBob: Ah. [SpongeBob blows his two thumbs-up] Whoo, I'm giving away thumbs-up today.
SpongeBob: Hey, guy. Way to wait. [SpongeBob gives Fish Guy two thumbs-up.]
Fish GuyÂ : Who, me?
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob put his left thumbs-up on his mouth makes gives Fish Guy big one right thumbs-up.]
Fish Guy: Yeah... [whistling]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob gives Fish Guy one thumbs-up]
SpongeBob: Hey, guy. Way to walk. [SpongeBob gives Fish Guy two thumbs-up.]
Fish Guy: [whimpers] [thud]
SpongeBob: Oh, this feels great.
SpongeBob: Way to flick that eye booger-- [SpongeBob gives Other Fish Guy two thumbs-up.] [His thumbs snap, then a live-action footage of trains crashing shows, with a new live action footage every time his thumbs snap, followed by a bridge falling apart, a tree falling, a crow, and a baby crying. Eventually, SpongeBob breaks his thumbs]
Thumbhawk two: Thumbhawk one. Thumbhawk one. This is Thumbhawk two. We got two thumbs down. Repeat. Two thumbs down!
Thumbhawk one: Thumbhawk one here, copy that. Initiate emergency procedures.
Thumbhawk two: Initiating on my count. Three, two, one.
Thumbhawk one and two: [Screaming]
SpongeBob: My thumbs. My thumbs! My thumbs!
SpongeBob: How's it looking, Dr. Manfish?
Dr. Manfish: Well, I'm afraid it doesn't look good, SpongeBob. It seems you've severely damaged your ulnar collateral ligament, possible from some kind of repeated action.
SpongeBob: An action like a thumbs-up?
Dr. Manfish: Certainly that is one possibility. Hitchhiking could be another.
SpongeBob: But doctor, I will be able to use my thumbs again, right?
Dr. Manfish: [Dr. Manfish takes both his eye lenses off.] SpongeBob, I can't say that for certain. I'm only a board certified thumbologist. I don't know everything. I can only say that we must give it time and see. There are limits to science. But you should prepare yourself for the possibility that you may never regain the use of your thumbs again. [Dr. Manfish put his right eye lenses on.]
