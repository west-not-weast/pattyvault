SpongeBob: What the heck is going on with my fancy boot? [Goes over to fancy boot] Hey, knock it off! [Boot goes in circles faster]
SpongeBob: Alright, I warned you! [Whacks boot. The racket comes back around and hits SpongeBob in the face] You're a dirty fighter! Hmm, I gotcha now! Hi ya! [Karate chops boot. Gary bounces out]
Gary: Mmmeeooowwww!

Gary: [With soap in his mouth] Meewwwaaaawwwwoowwww! [SpongeBob removes the soap from Gary’s mouth] CWA! HE-HE! [Coughing tone]
SpongeBob: Phew, thank goodness. For a moment there, I thought you were hurt. [Shell starts to crack]

Gary: Moooooooowww.
SpongeBob: Of course it's a shell! [Gary looks at SpongeBob sternly] Oh, c'mon, don't look at me like that. [The slime on Gary's back covers the pants and the wet pants go soggy].
Gary: Moooowww.
SpongeBob: Okay, you’re right, it's not a shell. [Starts thinking] OH! [Comes back with a clear helmet over his head] Greetings, earthlings. I am SpongeBob. I come from the future. DA-HA-HA-DA-HA-HA. [takes off helmet] I bet this'll look great. [Puffy skin swirls up inside helmet]. Eeewww. I can see why snail shells aren't clear. [Takes helmet from Gary] Hmmmm.
Gary: Mooowww.
SpongeBob: Here it is, Gary. Your neeew shell! [puts on race driver helmet] Oh, you look ready to ride! [Gary throws magazine at SpongeBob] Shell Spiffy. Great idea, Gare, I'll order you a new shell. Are there any you have your mind on, ol' buddy? [Shows Gary magazine]
Gary: Moooowww.
SpongeBob: Oh, page 72. Oh, here it is. Wow! [Looks the same as Gary's old shell]. This stylish, fully insulated, dual coat ceramic shell comes with automatic restroom facilities standard, and for the affordable price of $9,595.95! Isn't there a place I can get a quality shell without spending a fortune!?
Gary: Mooowww.
SpongeBob: Commercial? What commercial? [TV is on]
Commercial Voice: Uh-Oh! Now look what you've done, you've broke your snail's shell again. [Man sweeping up snail shell pieces]
Man: Yeah. Now what do I do?
Angry Jack: You come on down to Angry Jack's Shell Emporium!
Commercial Voice: [Drop scene with shop name on it] Angry Jack's!
Angry Jack: I'm so angry about my massive inventory that I'm slashing prices like crazy!
Commercial Voice: Jack's Angry!
Angry Jack: $99.99 to buy this refurbished shell, and I'm angry about it! Or what about this one, brand new plastic shell, super-gloss coat, only $39.99! [Price appears in front of his eyes] Hey! Get those numbers outta my face! [Price disappears]

Commercial Voice: Jack is reeaalll mad! Don't bring your kids!
Angry Jack: And remember, I'll match, or beat, anyone advertised rage or is absolutely... hey. [Sees SpongeBob] What are you doing in my commercial?
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Angry Jack, eh, Gary here needs a new shell, and we knew you would help us find one. Hey, shouldn't you be yelling at me right now?
Angry Jack: Nah, I just do that to make my commercials louder. And louder, is the same as better! Now, let's see if I can't get you into a new shell. Hmmm. [starts scanning shelves] There she is. [Takes the same shell as Gary's old one] There ya go, little guy.
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, it's perfect! Just like the old one hey, buddy? [Shell falls off and breaks]
SpongeBob: Now, it... really looks like the old one, eh, buddy?
Gary: [Angry tone of voice] Meowwweeooowww!
Angry Jack: Hey, accidents'll happen. Why don't we try this one? [Picks up yellow shell with orange patches]
SpongeBob: Oooohh, that's nice, love the pattern. We'll take it, but first I gotta make sure it's battened down. We don't want this one slippin' off, eh, buddy? [SpongeBob pushes down shell so hard it cracks and breaks. Angry Jack looks at SpongeBob angrily]
SpongeBob: Oops. Hey, what about that one? [Walks to a shell with purple and orange stripes on it. Turns around to take to Gary, but whacks it on Angry Jack]
SpongeBob: Oops, sorry, Jack. Hey, how much is that one? [Picks up shades of pink stripes. Trips over lace and drops shell]
Angry Jack: Why don't you just hold your snail? I'll take care of the shells.
SpongeBob: Good idea, Angry.
Angry Jack: So, how do ya like this one? [Puts on very bright-lighted shell]
SpongeBob: Well it... certainly is shiny.
Angry Jack: It's our most reflective model.
SpongeBob: Ah, that is bright. Can't... see! OW, what was that!? [Bashes into shell shelves and knocks them over one by one. Shelves knock each other over like dominoes. Some shell shelves spell 'oops']
SpongeBob: Why... can't... I... stop... break-ing... shells!? [Screams and falls off shelf he was running along. View from outside Angry Jack's store]
SpongeBob: Whoops. Hey, Jack, I don't suppose you have any more to show me?
Angry Jack: I do have one more available. It's the only certified indestructible shell I've ever seen, but I'm sure you'll find a way.
SpongeBob: Wait, wait, wait! Before we do the hand-off, let me make some precautionary measures. Okay, first, [shoes pop from under shell bits] shoes are tied, hands are de-ry [pronounced dry] and now, a thick layer of bubble wrap. [starts wrapping shell in bubble wrap. Picks up shell, but the actual shell falls out of the bubble wrap layer and breaks]
SpongeBob: You, er... sure you don't have any more in the back?
Angry Jack: The back? There is no back anymore.
SpongeBob: Well, look on the bright side, I reduced your inventory for ya.
Angry Jack: Reduced? You destroyed everything! AND NOW, YOU’RE GONNA HAVE TO PAY!
SpongeBob: Are you really angry or ya just trying to sound louder?
Angry Jack: I'm really angry!
Commercial Voice: Blistering Fury!
Angry Jack: And I demand immediate payment!
SpongeBob: [Takes about 40 cents out his pocket] Take it, it's all my savings.
Angry Jack: This? This isn't enough to repay my fortune! I'm gonna need more!
SpongeBob: Sorry, that's all I got, honest.
Angry Jack: No, it's not! You've got two arms and two legs, don't ya?
SpongeBob: Yeah.
Angry Jack: Give me one of each!
SpongeBob: Okay. [Takes off one arm and one leg and gives them to Angry Jack]
Angry Jack: I'll also need some internal organs. [SpongeBob takes out his heart and gives it to Angry Jack] And an eyeball! [SpongeBob hands over an eyeball] And your clothes. [SpongeBob refuses and walks away fully formed again]
SpongeBob: [sadly] Oh, Gary. How I wish your shell could grow back like my appendages. [sees box] Hey, I've got an idea! [SpongeBob draws a shell pattern on the box]
Gary: [angry tone] Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary, it's not that bad! Square looks good on anybody!
Gary: [starts to cry] Mwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaa!
SpongeBob: [crying] Oh, what am I kidding? It looks terrible on you!
Gary: Mwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaaaa!
SpongeBob: [crying] I know, Gary, I ruined your life! Do you have to rub it in?!? [sobbing]
Mr. Krabs: Hey, boy, what's with all that snivelin'?
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs. What are you doing here?
Mr. Krabs: Well, I just, uh, well never mind that, boy. What's your problem?
SpongeBob: I destroyed Gary's shell, and now I can't find a replacement... So I guess he'll just spend the rest of his days as a lowly slug! [bawling]
Gary: Mwwwwwwaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwaaaaaaa!
Mr. Krabs: There, there, boy. There, there. It's not that bad. I'm sure you'll thinka something.
SpongeBob: [looks at Mr. Krabs' shiny shell and has an idea] Mr. Krabs, perhaps you can help me find a new shell for Gary.
Mr. Krabs: Well, I'd be honored to help you and your snivelin' snail during such desperate times. I love helping others. Like helping meself. Now, how much ya got?
SpongeBob: Nothing, Mr. Krabs. I'm broke.
Mr. Krabs: Oh. I see [walks away disappointed]
SpongeBob: Wait, Mr. Krabs! If you help me get Gary a shell, I'll, work for free for the rest of the year.
Mr. Krabs: Only if I get to cut your health benefit for ya.
SpongeBob: Deal! [Cut to SpongeBob's house, he has the same nightmare from the beginning, and woke up again] Oh, another bad dream. [Screams, He shines a flashlight at Gary] Mr. Krabs?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Gary, I'm not used to your new shell. [Mr. Krabs comes in]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, me boy, I need to borrow a blanket.
SpongeBob: There ya go, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Thanks, boy-o. Now I'm all toasty.
SpongeBob: [sighs] I guess "All's shell that ends shell". Huh, Gary? [laughs] That's a good one! [Gary goes furious and crawls back, Gary slams the door locking SpongeBob out] Gary? [pounds on the door] Gary? [Gary turns off the bedroom light] Gary?!
