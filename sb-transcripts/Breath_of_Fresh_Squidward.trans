Patrick: Could you pass the chips, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Sorry, Patrick. We're all out.
Patrick: Oh, barnacles! What am I going to do with all this dip? [SpongeBob and Patrick are sitting in chairs beside Squidward's bed.]
SpongeBob: Patrick! [Squidward screams.]
Squidward: What are you two morons doing?
SpongeBob: Waiting to watch the sunrise with you.
Squidward: At 3:47 in the morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh.
Squidward: In my bedroom?
SpongeBob: We come here every morning.
Squidward: You sneak into my house every morning?
SpongeBob: Uh-huh. [Squidward groans.]
Patrick: It's our favorite pastime.
SpongeBob: Ah, the memories we've shared, right in this room. They're all here in this memory book. [points to pictures] Here we are on the Fourth of July. And Valentine's Day. Oh, you looked so cute on Easter. [Squidward is groaning angrily.] What's wrong, Squidward?
