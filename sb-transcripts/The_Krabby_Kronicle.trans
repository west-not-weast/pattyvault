[episode begins at Krusty Krab with SpongeBob in the kitchen]
SpongeBob: Order up! [rings bell 3 times]
Mr. Krabs: How's it looking out there, boy?
SpongeBob: Like two more satisfied regulars, Mr. K.
Mr. Krabs: I ain't interested in same old regulars, SpongeBob! So I took out an ad in the Bikini Bottom Examiner to bring in some new customers! Twas a bargain too. [SpongeBob takes a magnifying glass and looks at it] Only cost me a nickel. So tell me now, boy. How many new customers we got out there so far?
SpongeBob: Oooh, let me see there was... none.
Mr. Krabs: What? What do you mean none? Don't these people read the paper? [walks outside to the newspaper carriers, blows on one] Oooh, this thing hasn't been touched in months. [notices the other one, and there is a long line] While that paper's selling like Krabby Patties. Uh, pardon me, sir. Could I interest you in a copy of the Examiner, this fine day?
Nat: Ha! Nobody reads the Examiner, bud. It's all full of boring charts and facts! [opens newspaper door] The Bottomfeeder's where it's at! It's got like interesting stories and stuff.
Mr. Krabs: [reading the newspaper] "Fishboy Strikes Again?" [not reading] Wait a minute, aren't these stories a little less than truthful?
Nat: I don't know. But they're selling!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, they certainly are. [lady puts in coin to get a newspaper] Please, allow me. [Mr. Krabs opens newspaper door]
Abigail: Thank you!
Mr. Krabs: No, thank you. [closes newspaper door] Now let's see how much they charge for advertising. [screams] 25Â¢ per word! The newspaper business sure is easy money! [Mr. Krab's shell cracks and underneath it is his body, but in money form] That gives me an idea! [The money falls out of place. Scene cuts to the next day at the Krusty Krab as SpongeBob walks in.]
SpongeBob: What a fantabulastical day! Eh, Squiddy?
Squidward: Yep, what another wonderful hum-drum day slinging burgers. [SpongeBob walks into the kitchen, but hits his face on something.]
Mr. Krabs: Off of your duff, boy. You think I spent all last night assembling this printing press, so you could laze around all day? From now on you'll be twice as busy. And I expect you to wear 2 hats. 'Cause along with your usual fry cooking duties, you're my new lead reporter for the new Krabby Kronicle! [A press badge on SpongeBob is shown]
SpongeBob: Oh! My very own press badge!
Mr. Krabs: That's right, boy! And here's your very own camera! So you'll need it to document all them juicy stories you're gonna write. Now what are you waiting for, boy? [cuts to SpongeBob walking down the street]
SpongeBob: On the thirst for a juicy story, eh? Hmm, but what kind of story is juicy enough to quench their dry news gullets? I don't even know where to begin to look. [there is a bank robbery going on, two tough fish destroying someone's boat with fire in the background, and a monster] No news to report here. Stop the presses, it's Patrick! And he appears to be waiting for the bus! This is the kind of breaking story my readers are waiting for! [takes a picture of Patrick] Patrick Star, I'm scoop SquarePants from the Krabby Kronicle. Everyone's wondering, what bus are you taking today?
Patrick: Oh, I'm not taking a bus, SpongeBob. I am watching this pole. So the next time it moves, I will see it!
SpongeBob: Whoa, this story is juicy! [cuts to the Krusty Krab where there is a sign that says "The KRABBY KRONICLE" on it. SpongeBob is writing on the typewriter, then puts it in a pile of papers, then finished the headline for the paper, then puts it in the printing press. Mr. Krabs walks in]
Mr. Krabs: What a money-tastical day! Eh, Mr. Squidward?
Squidward: Yeah, I'm just breaking it in.
Mr. Krabs: I'm excited about all the newspaper sales, too.
Squidward: We haven't sold any papers today. [as SpongeBob drives a wheelbarrow of newspapers]
Mr. Krabs: What do you mean we haven't sold any newspapers? Certainly this gentlemen would like a copy of the Krabby Kronicle.
Frank: Looks boring. Can I just have a Krabby Patty?
