Patrick: Hey! How'd we get up here? [Patrick is pushed off cliff, hits several rocks then falls off mountain]

SpongeBob: Ooh, I know. How 'bout a little something called Jump rope?
Johnny: Jumprope, eh? Demonstrate.
SpongeBob: Ready Patrick? On your mark, get set, jump rope!
Patrick: Extreme! [starts jumping] Hey, who's holding the other end?
SpongeBob: I am of course. [Pan to the right] Hi Patrick!
Patrick: D'uh. [blows harmonica, starts singing] My best friend is SpongeBob, he has a square head, I try on his clothes while he's asleep in bed.
SpongeBob: Yeah! What?
Patrick: That's weird, my face is leaking.
SpongeBob: You're face isn't leaking. You're just sweating from all the exercise.
Patrick: Exercise?! [stops] Eww, I didn't sign up for this! [faints]
SpongeBob: Extreme!
Johnny: Dude that was not extreme. Let the Drasticals show you how it's done. Grab it Granny [throws one end of jump rope, Granny bites end of rope, Ted makes a somersault and lands on rope with his tongue, jumps back into the air]
Ted: Drasticals! Whoo! Yeah! [Lands and jumps over rope to the point where he steams up]
Johnny: Kick it up a notch!
[Ted sets aflame and shoots into the air]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Ooooh.
Ted: Yeah! [plane hits him, he falls face first into ground and burns to a crisp]
Johnny: Yeah! See, extreme sports should be explosive! Boom!
SpongeBob: Explosive, huh? I know just the thing! [dips bubble wand and blows bubble. Bubble pops] Boom! [SpongeBob and Patrick make several explosion sounds] Impressed?
Drasticals: No.
Johnny: Look dudes, to be extreme you gotta go bigger. Show 'em Drasticals! [Granny climbs huge bottle of bubble soap, dips huge wand and puts it in front of a ramp] Watch this! [Rides motorcycle into bubble, speeds into town and knocks over a building. Bubble pops and he gets crushed] Extreme. [Tunnels back, hops out of the ground] Now that's how you do extreme! You understand?
SpongeBob: I think I do. Is fighting extreme?
Johnny: Fighting is totally extreme.

Johnny: Not so fast, that's not fighting. Stand aside [Stomps SpongeBob and Patrick out of ring] I'll show you how it's done! [Slams into pillow, puts into washing machine, sets it on wash]
SpongeBob: Noo! It's dry-clean only!
[Johnny smashes machine open, punches pillow out of ring]

SpongeBob: Brutal.
Mattress: Charlie! [Jumps into ring and smashes Johnny, then does it again 6 times more]
Patrick: Even more brutal!
Johnny: Now that was extreme, dudes. You think you're starting to get it?
SpongeBob and Patrick: Oh yeah.
Johnny: So what else you got?
SpongeBob: Well there is one sport that Patrick's an expert at.
Patrick: Dumpster diving!
[Patrick pushes dumpster, climbs it, and jumps in. SpongeBob cheers. Patrick sinks in and pops out, coughing up some trash.]
Johnny: That's not extreme.
Patrick: [Spits out old toothbrush] How revolting. [Brushes teeth with it]
Johnny: Okay, that's kinda extreme. Not bad, but the Drasticals will show you how it's done. [Ted brings in a ladder with diving board and Granny on top. Ladder is set higher]
Granny: Okay artificial hip, don't fail me now. [Jumps into dumpster and chuckles. Johnny dumps her and trash into a garbage truck and crushes them with a compactor. Trash comes out a square shape and Granny pops out] Extreme!
Patrick: That is one tough elderly person.
Johnny: Dude, that was awesome! What other crazy sports do you dudes play?
SpongeBob: Well, there is a very extremely extreme sport we play if you're up to it.
[At Jellyfish Fields, SpongeBob and Patrick chase after jellyfish]

[Johnny catches jellyfish on motorcycle, Ted in the air, and Granny riding them like a tidal wave]
SpongeBob: Wow!
Patrick: Amazing!
Johnny: Jellyfishing, yeah...[Jellyfish flies into his mouth and stings him, Ted flies into huge jellyfish and burns, thrown into Johnny and Granny and they get caught in an explosion]
Johnny: [Covered in stings] Dudes, now we get it! These spots are way extreme!
Ted: And itchy!
