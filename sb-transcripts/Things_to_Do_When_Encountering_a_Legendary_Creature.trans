Narrator: Things to do when encountering a legendary creature.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick, what are you reading?
Patrick: [whilst roller skating] Bikini Bottom Legends. It's a chapter called "Things to Do When Encountering a Legendary Creature." It says to be polite. [SpongeBob starts taking notes] Offer a gift, oh.
SpongeBob: Hey, Patrick?
[Raarg looms up in front of them]
Patrick: Yeah?
SpongeBob: Is run away on that list?
Patrick: Yeah, it is.
Raarg: [screaming] Rarr!
SpongeBob and Patrick: [they start running away and scream] Monster! [they scream again]
Raarg: [a tear rolls down his face] I'm so lonely.
