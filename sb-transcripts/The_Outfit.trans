Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Help me pick out an outfit for the party, Gary Bear.
Gary: Meow. [clattering, SpongeBob yodeling] Meow.
SpongeBob: Too much, huh? [clattering, Tarzan yell]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Too little? Yeah, little bit drafty, too. [clattering]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: Oh, Gary. You are a real stickler for authenticity. [he then returns to normal] Ta-dah!
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: You're right, Gary. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.
Gary: Meow.
