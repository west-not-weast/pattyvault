[Opening at Squidward's house. A clam crows like a rooster, causing everyone to wake up. Squidward is sleeping and hears noises. He awakens, revealing SpongeBob and Patrick under his blanket with a sign that reads "happy birthday"]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Surprise! Happy birthday, Squidward! [all three standing in front of a cake] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday cake! [standing in front of a picture of a seahorse and Squidward has the tail] Happy happy birthday! Pin the tail on the seahorse! [surrounded by presents] Happy happy birthday! Happy birthday, Squidward! [SpongeBob and Patrick run out of Squidward's house]
SpongeBob: Yeah! So long, Squidward, bye-bye, don't do anything I wouldn't do.
Patrick: Another year older. [laughs]
Squidward: It's not my birthday! [shuts door and takes off party hat] That's it! I'm moving out of this neighborhood!
Realtor Lady: [looking at a picture of Squidward's house] Absolutely, Mr. Tentacles! [showing the Realtor lady as Patty Rechid from Bikini Realty on phone] I can sell your home in a heartbeat.
Squidward: Oh, that's great news, because I want to move as soon as possible.
Patty: No problem! As long as it's not infested with nematodes, or surrounded by troublesome neighbors or something like that.
Squidward: Oh sure, there's none of that... Did you say "neighbors?"
Patty: Of course! I can't tell you how many times I've seen a sale fall through because of bad neighbors.
Squidward: Neighbors. Uhh...
Patty: Anyway, I'll be by tomorrow to check out the house. See you then! [both hang up]
Squidward: SpongeBob! No one will ever buy my house with him living next door! Whatever a good neighbor would do, he does the opposite! Opposite... opposite... [night turns to day then rooster crows everyone up. Later, SpongeBob is sleeping, but is awakened from Squidward's instrument playing outside]
