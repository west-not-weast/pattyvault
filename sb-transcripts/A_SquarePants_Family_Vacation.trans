[Mr. Krabs walks outside of his house, opens his mailbox, and then sticks his claw into it.]
Mr. Krabs: [With his eyes closed] Please be money, please be money. [Pulls out postcard from mailbox.] Oh! That's not money. It's from SpongeBob. [Puts on his glasses, and reads the postcard] "Dear Mr... Krabs, please come to my house tonight. I am having a free money party." Free money party!? This sounds too good to be true!
[Cuts to scene to show Squidward by his mailbox]
Squidward: [Reads postcard] "Dear Squidward, come to my house tonight I am having a... [surprised] ...latte sipping contest?" This sound too good to be true!
[Cuts to inside of Sandy's treedome]
Sandy: [Reading postcard] "Please come by my house tonight. I'm having a science fair!" Oh, SpongeBob, this sounds too good to be true!" [Her science experiment fizzes]
[Cuts to Larry lifting weights]
Larry: [Reading postcard] "I am having a weight lifting competition!?" This sounds too good to be true!
[Cuts to Mrs. Puff at boating school]
Mrs. Puff: [Gasps as she reads postcard] "A quiet evening studying the rules of the road!?" [Laughs] Oh! Ahem... That sounds too good to be true.
[Cuts to the inside of the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [Reading postcard] "A meeting of the minds to discuss the ultimate downfall of the Krusty Krab!?" This sounds too good to be true!
[Cuts to Mr. Krabs knocking on SpongeBob's door]
SpongeBob: [opens the door] Welcome, friends! Please come in!
[Everyone walks inside]
SpongeBob: I'm so glad you all could make it! Tonight is going to be a magical evening filled with... magic!
Mr. Krabs: Eh... SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Yes, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Can we skip the magic and get right to the free money?
Squidward: How 'bout the latte sipping?
Larry: And what about the pumping of the iron?
Plankton: And diabolical conspiracies?
Sandy: And let's not forget the science fair!
SpongeBob: The real reason I called you here was to watch this slideshow of photos from my family vacation!
Squidward, Sandy, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, Mrs. Puff, Larry, and Pearl: I knew it was too good to be true!
[Patrick then bursts through the crowd]
Patrick: Ahaha! Ahaha! Sorry I'm late, SpongeBob! I had to find my movie watching hat!
Plankton: That does it... I'm gone. [Plankton starts to leave, but the others exit, and Larry squishes him, followed by Pearl, Mrs. Puff, and Sandy, all stepping on him] Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
SpongeBob: Wait! Wait! You're going to miss the first slide! [Clicks button and sticks his tongue out]
[A slide of Patrick appears on the screen next to the wall.]
Squidward: Looks more like a slip than a slide. Ha ha!
Mr. Krabs: I've seen enough.
[They start leaving while Sandy is angry]
SpongeBob: Wait! Come back! [Moves projector] See, it's Patrick!
Patrick: Hey! It's me!
Squidward: Why is it all orange and blurry?
SpongeBob: Where?
Squidward: See, right there on the entire thing!
SpongeBob: Oh! That's because Patrick keep spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz!
[Ripples to SpongeBob taking picture]
SpongeBob: Patrick! You're spraying the camera with Cheese Fizz! The pictures will come out all orange and blurry.
Patrick: I can't help it, SpongeBob! I'm so excited about going on a family vacation with you and your parents that my aim is off! [Patrick sprays himself in the eye with Cheese Fizz.] See? [Patrick blinks, squirting the Cheese Fizz into his mouth and then lick his lips.] There we go...
SpongeBob: I know what you mean. Sometimes it feels like I've been waiting my entire life to go on this trip!
Patrick: Really? Why is that?
SpongeBob: Probably because I have.
Patrick: Have what?
SpongeBob: Been waiting.
Patrick: [Breathing heavily] Wait... you mean so... What?
[SpongeBob throws the camera behind him and then gasps]
SpongeBob: Patrick! They're here!
[SpongeBob's parents pull up in their station wagon. Harold pokes his head out of the window.]
Harold: Good morning son, are you ready to head out?
SpongeBob: You bet!
Margaret: SpongeBob! Don't leave your luggage behind! [points to Patrick]
SpongeBob: [laughs] That's not luggage, it's Patrick! He's coming with us, remember?
Harold: Well, shake a leg boys. The Great Barrier Reef isn't gonna visit itself!
Margaret: Your father's right son!
Harold: [Muttering] They know I'm right...
[Cuts to the family driving.]
Patrick: [As SpongeBob pulls out a map] You brought homework?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick, it's a brochure detailing all the fun we'll have at our final destination! [opens brochure] The Great Barrier Reef! See? there's a huge assortment of slides, and trampolines...
Patrick: [Drooling] And forts...
SpongeBob: And ropes to swing on...
Patrick: [Still drooling] And forts.
SpongeBob: And a water park! [Camera zooms out, pans to Patrick drooling on map.] Oh wait, that's just where you drooled on it. [Closes brochure] I can't wait to get there! How about you?
Patrick: No, I can't.
SpongeBob: [With his eyes closed] Yeah...
Patrick: [Sweating] No, I mean I really can't. [Shouting] I've been in this confined space for too long, somebody help! [bangs on the car windows] Get me out of here! 
[Cuts to the car driving on the ride with Patrick silently banging on the window.]
Harold: Alright, boys, alright, turn down the volume back there.
Margaret: [Turns to face the backseat] I have an idea! Why don't we play a road game to pass the time?
SpongeBob: Yeah!
Maragaret: Anybody know any?
Patrick: [Raises hand frantically] Oh! Oh! Oh! Hide and seek! [Patrick dives under the passenger seat.]
SpongeBob: Hey, why does he get to go first?
Harold: [Singing] "And she threw it all away..."
Patrick: [Flies into windshield] Okay find me!
Harold:  Egad!
