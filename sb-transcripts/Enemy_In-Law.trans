[In the city part of Bikini Bottom, everyone screams and points at a giant Plankton robot as it grabs a handful of people in each hand and drops them inside the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: [everyone running around inside] Oh, good, the lunch rush. Now that my ChumBot has dropped you into my clutches, you'll be forced to eat at the Chum Bucket. [everyone stops in their tracks]
Nat: What?! You mean you kidnapped us just to sell us your fast food?
Plankton: C'mon, it's a standard marketing technique. [people leave]
Nat: You little twerp!
Plankton: Hey!
Karen: He's right, ya know.
Plankton: Karen?! You think I'm a twerp?
Karen: Well, yes, but I was referring to the kidnapping.
Plankton: Everything I do is always wrong in your eyes.
Karen: Maybe it's because you are always wrong.
Plankton: Fine, I'm wrong and you're right.
Karen: You said it, not me. You know, you're lucky to have me.
Plankton: [walking away] Why did I ever install that nagging software?
Karen: Nagging software? I heard that! Come back and dust my screen!
Mr. Krabs: Oh, money. You're always there for me. [kissing noisily]
Mama Krabs: Hello, Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: Mother! Uh, what brings ya by today?
Mama Krabs: I just wanted to see my favorite son.
Mr. Krabs: How much of my money do you want?
Mama Krabs: Well, I did see the prettiest hat in town today.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, look at the time! So sorry to have to rush off. Bye! [pushes Mama Krabs out his office and closes his door] Whew, that was a close one.
Plankton: Why did I ever buy that computer wife? I need a real woman - not a girl in a cold-hearted shell. [Plankton hears Mama Krabs humming outside so he brings down his periscope on her] Such beauty. She's an angel; and no wires. I've never felt like this before. I don't even know her name and yet she's stolen my heart.
Karen: Plankton! You've fallen in love with another woman?! I'm your wife!
Plankton: You're a W.I.F.E..[pulls out chart] Wired Integratred Female Electroencephlagraph.
Karen: Oh, you always pull that one out! "You're not a real wife, you're just a computer!"
Plankton: [sighing] Why don't you have an 'off' switch? [sees an off switch and smiles]
Karen: Plankton, don't you dare... [turns off]
Plankton: And now to woo that beloved creature. [cut to Mama Krabs taking a nap while Robot Plankton is looking through her window. Then the robot grabs her]
Robot Plankton: Roses are red. Violets are blue. World domination has nothing on you. [she screams]
Plankton: Hmmm, I guess she's not a poetry fan. [everyone is running around screaming while the robot is using its eye laser to spell out "I [heart] You" on the ground, but while destroying some of the town when doing this. Mama Krabs reads it and screams a few times] Poetry, love notes--nothing's working. Perhaps something personal. [Mama Krabs is shrieking. The robot walks over to a rock and karate chops a memorial-like statue of Mama Krabs' head and puts her down]
Mama Krabs: [stops screaming] Am I really that pretty?
Plankton: Oh, yeah... I am smooth. [cut to later in his restaurant by a phone] Just dial the number and ask her to dinner. C'mon, you can do this. [dial tones beeping; Plankton grunting]
Mama Krabs: Hello? [Plankton panting in the phone] I'm hanging up.
Plankton: Wait! This is your secret admirer.
Mama Krabs: Oh, you're that giant robot?
Plankton: [laughing] No. I program the robot. Did you enjoy the gift I sent you?
Mama Krabs: How did you know I wanted a hat? Have you been spying on me? [6 TV screens are set-up to in different parts of Mama Krabs house]
Plankton: It was...just a lucky guess. I've admired you from afar for far too long, my angel. We must meet face-to-face.
Mama Krabs: Well, how about the Krusty Krab? Tonight at 8:00?
Plankton: Sounds wonderful. I'll be the tall fellow wearing a red carnation. Until tonight, my dear. [cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Ah! Quick, SpongeBob, swallow me wallet!
SpongeBob: OK. [Mr. Krabs shoves his wallet in SpongeBob's mouth and SpongeBob swallows it]
Mr. Krabs: Oh, sorry, Mommy. I can't lend you any money. SpongeBob accidentally swallowed me wallet. [sniffs his mother's hat] Mommy, you got yourself a hat without my financial assistance.
Mama Krabs: Isn't it nice, Eugene? It's just the one I wanted.
Mr. Krabs: But, Mommy, you shouldn't be spending my inheritance...I mean, since you told me you wanted a hat, I went out and I dug one up. [takes out a hat with holes in it]
Mama Krabs: Where did you get this old thing? [at a funeral where two fish are paying their respects to the person in the coffin]
Nat: She looks so peaceful.
Fred: Yeah. But wasn't she wearing a hat? [Mr. Krabs is seen running out with the hat behind him]
Mama Krabs: You can take this one back to the trash heap.
Mr. Krabs: Yes, Mommy. [tosses hat and shovel to Squidward] Squidward, I need you to make a return for me.
Mama Krabs: Thank ye for your concern for my finances, but me new boyfriend bought me this hat.
Mr. Krabs: Boyfriend? Someone to spend money...I mean time with you? That's wonderful! Who is he? What's his name?
Mama Krabs: I don't know. I'm meeting him here, tonight.
Mr. Krabs: Wonderful! I'll stay open late so ye can have a nice, romantic dinner. Run along, make yourself pretty. SpongeBob, you're working late tonight. No overtime! [SpongeBob lunges himself into the door. Cut to Plankton wearing a rose, walking into the Krusty Krab where SpongeBob is in a waiter uniform]
Plankton: [clears throat] I've reservations for two, tonight.
SpongeBob: Right this way, sir. [SpongeBob pulls back the chair for Plankton as he jumps up on it]
Plankton: [shouts] Excuse me, I can't reach my silverware!
SpongeBob: Terribly sorry, sir. [reaches into his pocket and takes out a miniature table and chair. Places it on top of the big table, then grabs Plankton and places him in the chair] Will there be anything else?
Plankton: Is my tie on straight?
SpongeBob: You look fabulous! [Mama Krabs walks in] Your gentlemen caller awaits. [Mama Krabs walks up to the table]
Plankton: [pulls rose away from his body] Hello, my dear. I must say you look ravishing tonight. [Mama Krabs notices Plankton]
Mama Krabs: Oh, my, you're a tiny thing, but awfully cute. Tell me about yourself. [sits down in a chair that SpongeBob has brought to her]
Plankton: Well, I'm in the food service business. I'm a bit of a restaurateur. I'm the founder and owner of the Chum Bucket.
Mama Krabs: Never heard of it.
Plankton: [Points to the Chum Bucket] It's across the street.
Mama Krabs: Doesn't ring a bell. [Plankton shows her the back of a phone book with a picture of him and the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: It's on the back of the phone book! Come on! I paid a lotta money for that ad! [Puts the book away] Never mind, never mind. I'd like to hear about you.
Mama Krabs: Well...
Mr. Krabs: Plankton!
Plankton: Krabs!
Mama Krabs: Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: Mommy?
Plankton: "Mommy?"
SpongeBob: [jumps in the air] SpongeBob!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob...!
Plankton: This delectable creature is your mother?
Mr. Krabs: This no-good conniving chiseler is your date?
SpongeBob: And this devilishly handsome sponge is your waiter.
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! I don't know what sort of skulduggery you're up to, Plankton, and I'm not waiting to find out. [picks up Plankton by his antennae]
Mama Krabs: Eugene, you put me boyfriend down, this instant!
Plankton: Boyfriend?
Mr. Krabs: But, mommy...
Plankton: You heard the lady. Let me go. [Mr. Krabs drops him into Mama Krabs' hand]
Plankton: That's more like it.
Mama Krabs: Come, Plankton. I'm sorry me son had to spoil our romantic evening.
Mr. Krabs: Mommy? [cut to Plankton cleaning a picture of Mama Krabs then in walks Mr. Krabs] You!
Plankton: Eugene.
Mr. Krabs: I came to warn you, Plankton. Stay away from me mother. I know what you're really up to.
Plankton: I'm serious, Eugene. I've changed my ways. And all it took was the love of a beautiful woman.
Mr. Krabs: All you love is thieving and conniving. Now, stop trying to get the formula out of me mother.
Plankton: What are you talking about?
Mr. Krabs: I'm talking about the Krabby Patty formula!
Plankton: Your mother knows the Krabby Patty formula?
Mr. Krabs: Don't play stupid with me. Of course she does. It's an old Krabs family recipe. And you're not family! [Plankton frowns] I'm telling you for the last time: stay away from me mother. [walks out]
Plankton: Not family, eh? I can fix that. [cut to Mama Krabs walking into the Krusty Krab]
Mama Krabs: Eugene!
Mr. Krabs: Mommy!
Mama Krabs: What did I tell ye about interfering in me life?
Mr. Krabs: Mommy, can't you see? He's trying to seduce the Krabby Patty formula right from under you.
Mama Krabs: For your information, Eugene, he hasn't asked me once about the formula. I doubt that he even knows that I know it.
Mr. Krabs: [chuckles nervously, pulling his shirt as he realizes he let that slip needlessly.] Uh, yeah...funny thing about that.
Mama Krabs: I forbid ye to interfere in me private business. Go to your office, now!
Mr. Krabs: Yes, mommy. [walks into his office]
Plankton: Somebody call heaven because I think an angel's gone missing.
Mama Krabs: Oh, Sheldon.
Plankton: Oh, Mrs. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, brother.
Plankton: Attention, attention, everyone. I'd like to make an announcement. Mrs. Krabs, in full view of this restaurant, I ask you for your hand in holy matrimony.
Crowd: Aw!
Plankton: Would you marry me? [big diamond ring shown up close]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, that's it! No more hiding in my room like a scared little kid, it's time to act like a man! [jumps at Plankton]
Plankton: Gasp!
Mr. Krabs: [jumps in his mother's lap] Please don't marry him, mommy! Don't marry this bad, bad man! I don't want you to!
Plankton: Too late, Krabsy. We're going to be married. And you're gonna be my new son! [laughs maniacally. Mama Krabs hands the ring back to Plankton] Huh? What's this, honey bunch?
Mama Krabs: I'm flattered by your offer, really I am, but I'm just not ready for that kind of commitment. [Mr. Krabs laughs]
Plankton: What is this? There's somebody else, isn't there? [Robot Plankton stomping thunderously]
Robot Plankton: [breaks into Krusty Krab with flowers] I... I... this is very uncomfortable. I'll just wait in the car.
Plankton: I don't believe this! You led me on!
Mama Krabs: Now, now, Plankton, it's not what ye think.
Plankton: I don't want to hear your lies! You owe me for leading me on like this! Give me the Krabby Patty formula and we'll call it even.
Mama Krabs: The formula? Is that what this whole thing was about?
Plankton: No, no, not really. I mean, not at first. I mean uh...honey bunch? Uh-oh. [Mama Krabs shows her muscles, which show as ships cannons. She punches Plankton back to the Chum Bucket] Oh, well, 'tis better to loved and lost than never to be loved at all! [Plankton ends up flying into the ON switch of Karen]
Karen: Working.
Plankton: So, you decided to come crawling back to me, huh?
Karen: [a laser machine comes down] What did you say?
Plankton: [chuckles nervously] Nothing, dear.
Karen: [zaps him] Yeah, that's what I thought you said, honey bunch. [Plankton groans]
