[The episode begins with SpongeBob and Patrick getting ready to go bicycling. SpongeBob puts on his helmet while Patrick puts Gary on his head.]
SpongeBob: Patrick!
Gary: Meow. [slithers off Patrick's head]
SpongeBob: You need a helmet that fits properly!
[Patrick puts on his helmet and gives a thumbs up. However, his helmet is too tight and breaks off.]
SpongeBob: And make sure your bike is the right size. Your feet should touch the ground while sitting.
[Patrick is sitting on a really big penny-farthing.]
SpongeBob: Uh, Patrick?
Patrick: [grunts as his head sticks out of the water] Mine's too big.
French Narrator: A little later...
[SpongeBob and Patrick ride their bicycles on the right side of the road.]
SpongeBob: Now, ride on the right side of the road and follow all traffic signs.
Patrick: [reading sign] "The End."
Both: [laugh] Together, let's make safe happen!
