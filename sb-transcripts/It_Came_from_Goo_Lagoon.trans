It_Came_from_Goo_Lagoon
185
French Narrator: ["The Goo Lagoon" sign is shown at Goo Lagoon] Ah, Goo Lagoon. A relaxing retreat for the citizens of Bikini Bottom. [The scene starts to pan through a wide shot of Goo Lagoon] A place for fun and frolic, but soon fun shall turn to fear, [The panning stops at the lagoon itself] for deadly danger creeps their way [creepy-looking words appear that read "IT CAME FROM GOO LAGOON!"] and it came from Goo Lagoon. [A female scream is heard] 
[The scene changes to show the bottom half of Dale exiting the lagoon. The scene pans up to reveal that he is licking a pink ice cream cone. The scene widens to show that he is passing Tommy with a red shovel and orange pale digging up sand and putting it in the pale, Scooter and Bill sunbathing, Nat rubbing sunscreen on Abigail-Marge's back, and Dennis playing volleyball with Nazz-Mimi. He stops just in time to see SpongeBob wearing his red swim suit and Patrick wearing a just light green swim suit and red swim cap pass by him. The scene follows Patrick and SpongeBob until they stop. They give each other excited faces and start laughing with excitement. They Run away from an oncoming tide. They chase the receding tide. They go back and forth two times. The scene zooms into show just their faces. They continue to laugh. The giant shadow of a giant wave emerges]
SpongeBob and Patrick: Uh-oh.
[The scene pans out to show the giant wave. The two get submerged in the wave. The scene changes to the open lagoon. SpongeBob and Patrick's bottom half float into the scene. SpongeBob gets up and gasps. He turns Patrick right-side-up]
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Yes, Patrick?
Patrick: Do you know how to swim?
SpongeBob: No.
Patrick: Me neither.
SpongeBob: Hmm, I wonder why we're not sinking to the bottom of Goo Lagoon. [A big round purple object lifts Patrick into the air. Patrick screams] Patrick, you're floating!
Patrick: Oh. [another one lifts SpongeBob in the air] Hey, you're floating too! What happened?
SpongeBob: [He looks down at his object] These weird bubbles saved us.
Patrick: [He pokes on his bubble] It's all purple and sticky.
SpongeBob: [He sticks his hand on the bubble and stretches it a little] And it's really stretchy. It's some kind of goo bubble.
Patrick: [He smells the goo bubble] Well, the smell makes my nose tickle. [He sneezes which causes the bubble to bounce on the lagoon's surface. He giggles.] Hey, it bounces! 
[SpongeBob and Patrick smile at each other signifying that that are thinking to do the same thing. SpongeBob and Patrick bounce on the lagoon's surface like they're playing on hopping balls while laughing. SpongeBob bounces above Nat, who is is a doughnut-shaped pool floaty that has red and white stripes on it. Nat sighs. Patrick bounces on him causing him to go under the lagoon's surface. He emerges through the floaty and gasps for "air"]
Patrick: Sorry! 
[The scene changes to show on a surfer, who is normally the lifeguard, wearing Patrick like pants surfing on a wave. SpongeBob goes through the top of the wave and hits him on the head. This causes him to lose his balance and wipe out. The surfer reaches the surface and gasps for "air". Patrick also bounces on him, causing him to go back under the surface of the lagoon. The scene changes to show a group of water ski acrobats and Thaddeus is driving the boat. The group consists of: on the bottom, Blue Fred, Sadie, and an orange fish; in the middle, Sandals and Nazz-Mimi; on the top, Dale, who is holding two red flags. Patrick comes and bounces on the group, knocking them over. The scene changes to show Plankton selling chum in a cart on the beach, while wearing a farmer's hat and a red bandanna]
Plankton: Chum! Get your red, hot chum here! What's the deal? According to my algorithm, [He takes out a calculator with the number "102682" on it.] beach-goers should be famished [He throws the calculator behind him] and looking for a treat. A treat like chum! Hello? It's perfectly edible, people! [A pole destroys Plankton's chum cart and causes his outfit to fly away] Oh, come on, man! This is my livelihood! 
[The scene widens to show Squidward, wearing a blue swim suit, behind an orange beach chair putting up an orange and yellow umbrella, which was the thing that crushed Plankton's cart]
Squidward: [opens his umbrella] Ah, a beautiful day beachside. I couldn't think of a thing that could ruin this. [lays down on his chair]
Plankton: I could think of a few.
Squidward: [puts tanning lotion on his nose and lays down to tan with his tanning mirror. A big shadow appears above Squidward] Hey, you're blocking my light. [SpongeBob appears from the sky, laughing, and crashes into Squidward with his goo bubble. This causes Squidward to go under the sand and to destroy both the umbrella and the chair. Squidward pops out of the sand] SpongeBob. [Another shadow appear and Patrick's laughter is heard. Patrick appears and also crashes onto Squidward, who screams, with his goo bubble. Again, Squidward goes under the sand. Squidward pops out of the sand with his tanning mirrors stuck to his head like a flower's petals. Plankton walks up to Squidward]
Plankton: Ah, sweet karma. It can come from the most boneheaded of places. [He notices SpongeBob and Patrick bouncing on their goo bubbles while laughing] Wait a second. What are those bouncing blobs of goo?
Squidward: [growls] I don't know and I don't care! [SpongeBob and Patrick continue to bounce and laugh on their goo bubbles until Squidward steps in front of them] Hold it! [SpongeBob and Patrick stop bouncing and their bubble drop to the ground] What I want to know is why you two have ruined my attempts of having an even tan!
SpongeBob: Oh, sorry, Squidward. We're riding on these cool [He steps off the bubble and lifts it] goo bubbles. They're floating out of Goo Lagoon. 
[A strange robot comes out of the water and everyone screams and runs away in horror, except for SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward who are too shocked to move. The robot opens itself revealing that it was just a suit controlled by Sandy.]
Sandy: Stop! [She exits the suit] Those bubbles are dangerous!
Plankton: Dangerous?
SpongeBob: [The scene changes to show Squidward, Patrick and SpongeBob. Patrick and SpongeBob are holding their bubble separately] Fascinating. Tell us more.
Patrick: Yeah, but with visual aids.
Sandy: O-kay... [pushes a button on the front of her suit that opens up a projection screen while her tail holds a projector. The projection says "DANGER" (in red letters) "BENEATH THE SEA FLOOR" (in gold letters). The visual is of a normal undersea background] My scientific investigation has [the camera cuts to the projection screen] revealed that deep beneath the lagoon floor is a volcanic pocket of super goo. [The visual changes to show 5 layers: the top is the lagoon, the second is an light orange straight section that is probably the floor of the lagoon, the third is a red straight section that might be lava, the fourth section is straight and light brown and slightly smaller than the second layer, the fifth layer is a blackish straight layer that is about double the size of the third layer. The fifth layer also contains a purple section in the middle that has the words "SUPER GOO" in gold letters. The visual aid then shows a zig-zag section that goes from the super goo section all the way to the top of the second layer/bottom of the lagoon] A crack has formed releasing bubbles of the goo to the surface which are toxic and very unstable.[The visual aid changes to show the crack at the bottom of the lagoon floor releasing super goo that forms a bubble. The bubble starts to morph and then it pops all over the visual aid.] At any moment, it could lose its integrity and boom! It'll explode!
[The scene changes to show Plankton next to a red bucket with a button panel on it.]
Plankton: That rodent's right. A giant goo bubble could really level the playing field. If someone were able to control its power, they'd control all of Bikini Bottom. And I'm going to be that someone. [lifts the panel's cover and pushes a red button on the bucket and door opens. The exterior is barely shown, but of what is shown, it looks similar to the Chum Bucket's lab interior. He goes inside and the door closes. The bucket sinks into the sand and a purple and light purple clam-shaped sub flies out and dives into the lagoon.]
[The scene changes to show SpongeBob and Patrick holding their goo bubbles separately.]
SpongeBob: It's so gooey. [stretches the goo bubble]
Patrick: [shoves the goo bubble into his mouth; muffled] I can fit it in my mouth. Oh, it tastes like licorice.
Squidward: [off-screen] You idiots! [the scene widens to show him] That goo is dangerous! Weren't you two morons listening?
Patrick: [muffled] No, not really. I drifted off.
SpongeBob: But just look at all the cool stuff it can do. [stretches the goo bubble and makes it into a form of a top hat] You can make a hat. [put it on his head and spreads the goo around his face] Or a beard.
Patrick: [Patrick wears the goo bubble on his head in a Elvis Presley hairstyle] Or an awesome toupée.
Squidward: Toupée? You mean hair? [grabs a goo bubble that is floating towards him and put it on his head. Then, he stretches it and makes it into hair] How do I look?
Sandy: What is wrong with you people?! That goo can destroy everything!
Patrick: [SpongeBob and his goo bubble are stuck on right side of Patrick's head] Seems safe to me.
Sandy: That's what they said about microwave ovens, dry cleaning, and corn dogs!
[The scene widens to show Squidward messing with his "hair" and Patrick and SpongeBob sitting on their bubbles]
SpongeBob: See you later, Sandy.
Patrick: Yeah, these goo bubbles won't bounce themselves. 
[Patrick and SpongeBob bounce away on their goo bubbles while Squidward continues to mess with his "hair"]
Sandy: You have been warned! 
[The bubble transition appears and the scene changes to show Sandals playing volleyball with Pilar. Pilar hits the ball too hard, it flies into the lagoon]
Sandals: Oh, man, where will we get another ball?
[The Scene widens to show SpongeBob bouncing on his bubble while holding a smaller goo bubble]
SpongeBob: Why not try a goo bubble? [He gives them the smaller goo bubble. He bounces away]
Pilar: Thanks. [the goo sticks to his fin] Hey, it sticks like glue! Go long! [Sandals runs off as Pilar throws the goo bubble. But since it was stuck to his fin, it sends him flying into the lagoon. He pops out] Awesome! I still got it! I wish I could swim. [sinks back in]
Thaddeus: [wipes his head] It's so hot. [SpongeBob and Patrick arrive, each on their goo bubble, and Patrick makes a beach umbrella out of a passing goo bubble that is smaller than then ones the two are sitting on] Oh, it's so cooling. [SpongeBob and Patrick bounce off] Thanks, goo!
Squidward: Thanks, goo!
Pilar: [under the lagoon] Thanks, goo!
Tommy, Sadie, Orange fish from earlier, Billy, Nazz-Mimi, and Brown girl fish: Thanks, goo!
[The scene widens to show that at least the last one was part of a newscast. Johnny is seen on the news anchor set on a TV screen]
Johnny Erain: And now we go to Perch Perkins [The image of the Bikini Bottomites goes away and is replaced by Perch Perkins in front of some passing goo bubble while light green letters in the upper-left corner of the screen that read "LIVE" are shown] at the scene!
[The scene zooms into the image of Perch Perkins and now fills the whole screen]
Perch Perkins: That's right! Perch Perkins here at Goo Lagoon, bringing you the latest on this Super Goo event. [walks up to SpongeBob] What do you think of Super Goo, young man?
SpongeBob: [He looks nervous for a second and remains silent for a moment until he looks at the camera. He smiles] I'm on TV!
Perch Perkins: [walks up to Patrick] And you, sir, what's your opinion? [Patrick doesn't say anything] Uh, sir?
Patrick: [grabs Perch's suit] It's awesome.
Perch Perkins: [chuckles nervously] That's great. Let's get some comments from some other beach goers. [Sandy runs up and grabs the microphone]
Sandy: I have a comment: Super Goo is evil! [eye twitches] Stay in your homes!
Perch Perkins: [angrily grabs his microphone back from Sandy] Yes, siree. The goo bubbles certainly are getting folks excited.
[The "LIVE" in the corner goes away]
SpongeBob & Patrick: [bouncing on their goo bubbles] We sure are excited! [laugh]
[The bubble transition appears and the scene changes to show Plankton's clam-shaped sub in the depth of the lagoon surrounded by goo bubbles. The scene changes to Plankton on the interior. He is sitting on reddish brown seat and holding a yoke with a red button and a green button on it]
Plankton: [continues his search for the crack formed from the super goo under the lagoon. He lets go of the yoke] I can't find this thing anywhere. [pulls out his binoculars and looks to the left of the vehicle] Come on, now. Think, Plankton. [he looks up] If you were a giant bubble of dangerous goo, where would you be? [he goes back to the left]
Karen: [pops up] Sheldon, this ship wasn't designed to reach these depths.
Plankton: That's great, sweetheart.
Karen: If you continue this search much longer, your power supply will deplete and you'll sink.
Plankton: All right, Karen. I'll make sure I write that down in my book, titled, Insignificant Things My Wife Told Me.
Karen: Whatever. Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon. It's your funeral.
Plankton: What did you say?
Karen: I said, "Go get stuck at the bottom of Goo Lagoon."
Plankton: That's it, Karen! The goo bubble must be stuck at the bottom. We just have to get down there. Karen, cut the power to the entire ship. [Karen cuts the power and the ship starts sinking] Yes! [laughs evilly as his ship continues to sink until it finds the crack where the goo bubbles are coming from] Look, there it is! Karen, fire up the engine power. [Karen restarts the ship] With my mechanical clam digger, I'll crack open this goo-cano easy as a clam! Which is what it was built for, so... You know, that makes sense. [the ship lands into the crack as Plankton laughs evilly. Plankton pushes the button and the ship widens the crack] Yes! Yes! Bubble forth, my gooey wrath! [the lagoon floor begins to shake] And now to get the ding-dang out of here! [Plankton makes his getaway in his escape pod while the remains of his ship get swallowed up by the massive purple goo rising from the crack]
SpongeBob: Look! [a giant purple goo bubble forms out of the water] Giant goo bubble! [Sandy pops out from the sand under SpongeBob]
Sandy: See, I told ya! [breaths crazily] Run for your lives!
Patrick: Sandy's really getting out of hand. [cuts to black screen]
Perch Perkins: This is Perch Perkins reporting live from Goo Lagoon where I'm standing in front of what appears to be some sort of gigantic gooey bubble rising out of the water into the water. With me is Sandy Cheeks. Miss Cheeks, as Bikini Bottom's resident know-it-all, we look to you for answers. Who, what, how, why, when?
Sandy: Well, Perch, I won't really know anything until I run some tests but I can tell you it's pretty serious. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to get going. [reveals that Perch is sitting in the boat with her along with SpongeBob and Patrick]
Perch Perkins: Oh, yes. Of course. [Perch jumps into the water and pops up while his microphone is short circuiting] This is Perch Perkins and I'm soaking wet. Back to you.
SpongeBob: Wow, it's so big!
Sandy: That there is a Texas-sized bubble! [picks up one of the oars] First, we'll check its tensile strength. [taps on the bubble a few times] Tight as a drum.
Patrick: [takes the oar from Sandy] Oh, I want to play the drum! [attempts to hit it until Sandy grabs the oar]
Sandy: No, Patrick, don't! That thing's volatile! There's no telling what kind of damage it'll cause if it pops!
Patrick: Oh, fine. Here. I don't need that old stick anyways. [jumps into the bubble but bounces back causing him to crash into SpongeBob and fall in the water. Water splashes on Sandy's helmet]
Sandy: [pulls them out and back into the boat] Come on, guys. We still have more tests to perform. I need a sample. Be a darling and hand me that there bucket. [SpongeBob gets up and has a bucket stuck on his bottom. Patrick giggles at that as Sandy takes the bucket and grabs a bit of goo from the bubble] Ok, SpongeBob, put a little bit of that gloop into this analyzer. [SpongeBob pours the goo in the mouth of Sandy's analyzer. The analyzer scans the goo but goes haywire as a paper spits out] This is worse than I thought.
SpongeBob: Look, Sandy. [makes a painting of Sandy out of goo with Patrick and giggles with him]
Sandy: How many times do I have to tell you that stuff's dangerous? Now, how are y'all gonna clean that gunk off?
SpongeBob: [both SpongeBob and Patrick's hand are covered with goo] Oh, yeah. Gross. Good thing I keep a spare set of hands. [two extra hands pop out of his head, takes off the goo stained hands off, and throws them in the water]
Patrick: Oh, yeah! [Patrick rips his arm off but nothing happens]
SpongeBob: Uh, I have a better idea. [a bottle of bubbles pop out of his head and he mixes the soap with its wand] Hold out your hands. [blows bubbles on Patrick's hands and the bubbles clean the goo off]
Patrick: Oh, they shine!
Sandy: Well, it seems to have stabilized. As long as it doesn't get any bigger, there's not too much to worry about. [ground rumbles] That ain't good. [the force of the rumble causes a tidal wave which sends SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy flying while screaming and crashing onto the beach]
Perch Perkins: So, Miss Cheeks, what's the prognosis?
Sandy: Well, Perch, it's my considered opinion that now would be a good time to-- [ground rumbles] --run like heck! [everyone runs and screams]
Perch Perkins: [on tv] Well, there you have it. This is Perch Perkins about to be swallowed by a giant wave. [the wave crashes onto Perch and the TV goes into color bars screen. Everyone at Goo Lagoon is running for their lives and screaming as the giant goo bubble rolls on the beach.]
Patrick: [runs to an outhouse] I'll catch up! I've gotta use the can! [close the door until the giant goo bubble rolls onto it]
SpongeBob: [trips over a rock] Whoa! [lands on his head in the sand and Sandy pulls him out. The giant goo bubble almost rolls over SpongeBob and Sandy and begins to float in the air above them]
Sandy: Phew, that was a close one.
Patrick: Help, help! Help! [punches through the door] I'm out of toilet paper in here! [the outhouse begins to slide off]
SpongeBob: Look out! [SpongeBob and Sandy run as the outhouse crashes onto the ground. Patrick hangs on for his life but he begins to slip while some of the goo sticks on him. He screams. SpongeBob is reaching out for Patrick while Sandy is carrying him by the feet] Hang on, buddy! Just a little bit more! [grabs Patrick by his foot] Gotcha! [tries to pull him down but loses his grip] I don't gotcha! Whoa! [SpongeBob and Sandy fall over as Patrick, who is still stuck on the goo, stretches up as the goo detaches causing him to fall right on top of the goo bubble]
Patrick: Help! [sobs as the goo bubble drifts away]
SpongeBob: Now what do we do?
Sandy: We need to get to my submarine! Fast! [Squidward is seen riding on his recumbent bicycle until Sandy grabs him be the arms] Squidward, it's an emergency! I'm gonna need your bike! [Sandy lifts Squidward off his bike and gets on] Hop on, SpongeBob! [SpongeBob gets on and rides for a few seconds to Sandy's treedome. They get off and run inside]
Squidward: Sheesh, you'd think the sky was falling. [goo then splatters on top of Squidward] I am going to learn to keep my big mouth shut. [the goo bubble floats by the treedome as Patrick continues to scream until he begins to play with the goo. He then make a goo sculpture of SpongeBob]
Patrick: Howdy, SpongeBlob! I'm so glad you could stick around. [giggles] Glad. [SpongeBob and Sandy arrive in a submarine]
Sandy: [through her communicator] Hold on, Patrick! We're here to rescue you!
Patrick: Oh, go rescue somebody else. Can't you see I'm playing with my friend, SpongeBlob? [SpongeBob and Sandy look at each other in confusion. They fly above Patrick and release a grappling hook] Don't worry. I'll never leave you. [the hook grabs Patrick's head] Huh? [the hook pulls Patrick off the goo] No...! Good-bye, SpongeBlob! [Patrick gets pulled safely into the submarine as the hook left a dent on his head] Hi, SpongeBob! Hi, Sandy! [the goo bubble flies towards Bikini Bottom]
SpongeBob: So what do we do now, Sandy? That thing is headed straight for downtown Bikini Bottom.
Sandy: If that thing pops, we can kiss our beautiful town goodbye! [the townspeople takes Sandy's words too literally and starts to kiss the streets and the buildings and say goodbye to them. The goo bubble continues to fly above the city and rains goo on the townspeople and buildings. Everyone starts screaming. The bubble bends two skyscrapers. Cuts to the Bikini Bottom City Hall where a bride and a groom are getting married at the steps and the front door while everyone is cheering. A pile of goo splatters on top of the groom]
Groom: Help me, my beloved.
Bride: Don't touch me, you disgusting freak! [a drop of goo stains her wedding dress and she cries] My dress is ruined! [Sandy's sub flies underneath the bubble as it splatters goo on Nancy Suzy-Fish after she gasps]
Nancy's baby: [giggles] Mommy goopy! [goo splatters on Nancy's baby. Nancy runs away screaming with her baby while Tyler takes cover in a nearby trashcan. Once its safe, he sighs and climbs out covered in filth. The bubble continues to fly but this time towards the statue of King Neptune]
SpongeBob: Oh, no! It's headed right for Neptune's trident!
Sandy: I was afraid it might come to this. In order to save the city, we must destroy public property. [activates missiles at the bottom of her sub]
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy, why do you have missiles in your sub?
Sandy: You know, in case I get stuck in traffic. Here goes! [pushes button and launches the missiles. The missiles make a direct hit on the statue, but they instead make it into a skeleton form] Darn it! [the goo bubble approaches and SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick scream. However, the bubble flies above the statue] Huh? What the--?
SpongeBob: That's weird. It's like that bubble has a mind of its own.
Sandy: Or the mind of someone else. Look! [it is revealed that Plankton has been moving the bubble by pushing it from behind while he is inside the escape pod. He sighs] Plankton! I knew it!
Plankton: Yeah, it's me.
Sandy: What are y'all up to this time?
Plankton: Well, that's for me to know and for you to clam up!
SpongeBob: [gasps] Rude!
Plankton: Let's just say I've got big plans for this little bubble. [laughs evilly as SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick stare at him in disgust] Now, if you'll excuse me I have to go. [proceeds in pushing the goo bubble. SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick pursue him until he activates a continuous track on his escape pod. They continue to chase him around the bubble until Plankton laughs and speeds up]
Sandy: Dang it! We'll never catch him at this rate!
Plankton: Ha! They'll never catch me at this rate! [yelps as he sees Sandy, SpongeBob, and Patrick coming towards him at the front]
Sandy: [comes out of her sub] Oh, no, you don't! [throws a lasso on Plankton's pod and ties the rope on the hook] Come here, you little varmint! You stay right there! Yippee! We got him now! [Sandy, SpongeBob and Patrick jump out and run towards him]
Plankton: That's right, come to Papa.
Sandy: When we get you out of there, you've got some explaining to do!
Patrick: [runs past SpongeBlob] Hey again, SpongeBlob!
Sandy: We've got you surrounded, Plankton! Now, come out with your antenna in the air!
Plankton: Oh, dear, I guess you've got me. Oh, wait a second-- [pushes a red button] No, you don't! [Plankton's pod flies off]
Sandy: Retreat! Retreat!
Plankton: Aw, don't go so soon. [pushes a yellow button. The pod activates a giant plug] I hope you brought your dancing shoes! [the plug stabs on the bubble cornering SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy] 'Cause it's time to do the electric goo-boogaloo! [pushes a green button and the plug electrocutes SpongeBob, Sandy, and Patrick which causes the townspeople below to scream in fear as Plankton laughs evilly. SpongeBob, Patrick and Sandy are fried and Plankton pushes them off with the wind from his pod's rudder. As they fall, he continues to push the bubble. SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy fall and scream until they crash to the ground]
Patrick: [Patrick and Sandy are shown to be unharmed from the impact of the fall] Good thing we landed on SpongeBob. [it reveals that SpongeBob's spongy body saved them but SpongeBob is squashed under them]
SpongeBob: Yeah, good thing. [Sandy jumps off]
Sandy: Plankton, you creepy bacteria! Give me back my sub! [Plankton throws Sandy's sub at them as it crashes to the ground. Sandy gasps] My sub!
SpongeBob: There, there Sandy.
Patrick: Plankton, you're-- you're a big meanie-weenie! You won't be such a tough guy without that big old bubble!
SpongeBob: Tough guy? Bubble? Patrick! Eureka! Inspiration!
Patrick: Really? [smells his armpit] Do I need deodorant?
SpongeBob: No, but you're close. What we need is [pulls out his bubble bottle from his head] liquid soap. It's time to fight bubble with bubble!
Patrick: [scoffs] Bubbles. That's your answer for everything. [cuts to the Krusty Krab]
Mr. Krabs: Thank you, come again! [goo splatters onto Mr. Krabs' eyes] Hey, who turned out the lights? [wipes off the goo and looks up to see the giant goo bubble in front of his restaurant]
Plankton: Hello, down there, Krabs! Look, I brought you a pretty balloon! And in return, you can give me the Krabby Patty secret formula!
Mr. Krabs: Why in the world would I want to do that?
Plankton: Cause if you don't, [his pod pulls out a needle] I'm gonna pop this disgusting thing and destroy Bikini Bottom! [then his pod holds out his computer with the picture of the Krusty Krab and Bikini Bottom on it] As you can see, I projected the blast radius of this goo-bomic balloon and it's gonna cover pretty much everything in town.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, yeah? Well, I can't see nothing from down here!
Plankton: Oh, yeah? Well, look again, you dingus! [throws his computer down at Mr. Krabs]
Mr. Krabs: I won't be blackmailed! There's no way I'm giving you me secret formula!
Plankton: You heard him, Bikini Bottom! It's time to kiss clean goodbye! [prepares to pop the goo bubble as he laughs evilly, but is stopped by SpongeBob's voice]
SpongeBob: [standing on the Krusty Krab sign] Hey, you! Yeah, you! Hold it right there, mister!
Plankton: Eh, not again.
SpongeBob: Prepare to meet your match, you big, bubble bully! [Sandy is standing on the bubble bottle and stirs the liquid soap with a giant bubble wand]
Plankton: [his pod puts its needle away on its head] Well, this is interesting. Let's see where it goes.
Sandy: Thank Neptune for the Barg'N-Mart buck discount! [gives SpongeBob the giant bubble wand]
SpongeBob: Here goes. [jumps off the sign] Geroni-blow! [the bubble wand creates a big bubble which takes the form of a bubble giant] Pretty slick, huh? Get him! [the bubble giant runs towards Plankton]
Plankton: [gasps] Uh-oh.
Patrick: [slides down the pole] Whoo! [laughs] Oh, boy! Get him, you big bubble bruiser! [runs up in the middle of the confrontation] Whoo! [laughs] You're the man! Yay! [the bubble giant steps on Patrick's pointy head and begins to deflate and fly around]
Plankton: Okay, where were we? Oh, yeah! [grabs the needle and proceeds but the deflating bubble giant flies under and lifts the goo bubble higher and higher]
SpongeBob: There goes a real hero. He gave his life so we could stay clean. [the bubble giant lifts the goo bubble so high that it flies out of the ocean and into outer space. The bubble giant begins to evaporate as Plankton's face gets distorted a little while he grunts until he reaches space. The goo bubble bounces on the moon and hurdles back to Earth and into the ocean] Oh, no, he's coming back!
Sandy: And he's headin' right for us! [Plankton parachutes the bubble safely and slowly to the ground. The townspeople flee as SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy and Mr. Krabs scream until the bubble stops on top of them]
Plankton: That's it, no more messing around! Give me that formula or I'll destroy this stinkin' town! [hold out the needle]
Mr. Krabs: But I don't wanna!
Nat Peterson: You'd better do what he says or we'll tear your restaurant apart and give it to him ourselves!
Bill: Yeah!
Martha Smith: I just washed my car!
Bill: Yeah!
Mr. Krabs: [growls] Ok, I'll do it.
Bill: Yeah! [Martha and Nat look at him strangely as Mr. Krabs goes into his restaurant and gets the bottle containing the secret formula]
Mr. Krabs: [hands Plankton the bottle] Here. I hope you choke on it.
Plankton: [retrieves the formula from Mr. Krabs and opens his window] I can't believe it! After all these years, it's mine! [cries tears of joy and wipes a tear away] I'm so happy, I could just burst! This bubble that is! [everyone gasps and Plankton ruthlessly pops the bubble and the town is covered in purple goo as he laughs evilly. Everyone including SpongeBob, Patrick, Sandy, and Mr. Krabs are covered in goo]
SpongeBob: Oh, that dirty little double-timer!
Mr. Krabs: Don't worry. He's about to get what's coming to him.
Plankton: [flies his pod and uses the windshield wipers to clean the goo off the window] Now to see what's inside a Krabby Patty! "Just one ingredient:..." [rolls down the paper as he continues to read only to find that there is a TNT dynamite attached to it] Darn it, Krabs! [the dynamite explodes inside the pod and it crash lands on the roof of the Chum Bucket] Ow. [Mr. Krabs laughs at Plankton's failure with joy]
Sandy: [annoyed] Well, I don't see what you're so gull darn happy about! This is a catastrophe!
Mr. Krabs: Well, darlin', it's like this: Where you see disaster, I see dollar signs. So, SpongeBob, you got any of that bubble soap left? [cuts to a line of people who are waiting to get cleaned up] Please have your money ready! [Nat gives Mr. Krabs his money] Thank you! [opens up his cashier] Right this way. [Nat walks up and gets picked up by the bubble giant. The giant eats Nat and swirls him around and around inside until it spits him out with its foot. Nat is now all sparkly clean. The bubble giant then picks up Martha and gets cleaned as well]
SpongeBob: [stands there watching with Patrick and Sandy, still covered in goo. He and Patrick look happy but Sandy looks confused] See, Patrick? Bubbles are the answer to everything! [laughs as episode ends]
