[At the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob is making a Krabby Patty with a rainbow patty. He finishes it and briefly admires his work.]
SpongeBob: Order up!
Squidward: [wakes up to SpongeBob's voice and screams] What is that? [points to the rainbow Krabby Patty]
SpongeBob: I call it a "rainbowger." It contains all the colors of the rainbow. [zooms in to SpongeBob's shining eyes] It will bring the whole world together.
Squidward: Yeah, together to hea-.
[They are interrupted by the front door opening.]
Plankton: Hello! [shot zooms out and reveals Plankton is sitting in a small machine of some sort]
[SpongeBob and Squidward are startled by Plankton's sudden appearance.]
Plankton: [laughs] Let's see how popular your precious patties are after I zap all the color out of them with my color nullifier! [laughs] [presses a button on the color nullifier.]
[A beam shoots out of the color nullifier, which sucks the color from the rainbowger into the nullifier]
Plankton: [laughs] [the colors start to jam the color nullifier] Wha- What? Oh, no! It's taking in too many colors at once! [screams]
[The color nullifier stars shooting colors all around the Krusty Krab]
Frank: [color hits him] Ooh! [becomes purple with white spots]
Norma Rechid: [laughs at Frank] [gets hit by color] Eww! [becomes plaid]
Frank: [laughs at Norma Rechid]
Patrick: [color hits him; becomes brown, white, and pink, like his ice cream] Huh? [shurgs]
Plankton: [color continues to be blasted out of the nullifier] No, no! You should have no colors!
SpongeBob: [watches proceedings with black and white rainbowger still in his hand] [color hits him] Whoa! [transforms into many different colors before eventually becoming green] Hey, look at me! I'm a coloring book. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: [comes out of kitchen] What a wonderful publicity stunt! Thanks, Plankton! [gets hit by color, becomes striped purple and yellow]
[The force of the color nullifier still blasting color pushes Plankton out of the Krusty Krab]
[Squidward becomes rainbow]
SpongeBob: Ooh, Squidward! I didn't know you were such a colorful character. I'm green with envy.
Squidward: It's just superficial. Inside, I'm just blue.
