[It is a dark and stormy night at the Krusty Krab]
Nat: Boy, good thing I remembered my umbrella.
Mable: Me too.
[Nat and the old fish both walk out of the Krusty Krab and gets swept away by a tornado]
Abigail Marge: Come on, kids. [The family of fish also get swept away]
Dave: [walks outside] Ahh, too bad I forgot my umbrella. [walks away]
Mr. Krabs: Ahhh, the end of another successful business day. You know, Squidward, this kind of day always reminds me of money [pours the money out of his cash register] Ahhahhahah.... [Pilar gets swept away]
Squidward: Oh, yeah, that's nice. I'll be here working while you.....AHHHHHHHH! [sees an old fish at the door] Uh... Uh... Um... I'm sorry, maâ€™am, [gulps] but were closed. [The hagfish pours saliva out of her mouth] I know you're hungry, but- [The Hagfish pours out more saliva]. Uh... but we really are closed. Thank you, come again.
[Madame Hagfish slides through the door as Squidward closes it]
Squidward: Hey!! Closed means closed, Grandma! [Squidward closes the door and the fish is pulled back, the fish slides into the Krusty Krab. sighs] Oh, boy, Some people... [walks to the cash register]
Madame Hagfish: [goes to order] One Krabby Patty, please.
Squidward: I told you...we're closed! I was supposed to get out of here ten minutes ago! And besides, I already cashed the register out.
Madame Hagfish: Oh, but I-
Squidward: No.
Madame Hagfish: I-
Squidward: No.
Madame Hagfish: I-
Squidward: No way.
Madame Hagfish: Please I-
Squidward: Never...
Madame Hagfish: I brought exact change... [Holds out three small shells]
Squidward: [Eyes twirking] Ah-ha, that is what they cost...20 years ago. Krabby Patties cost $4.50, lady.
Madame Hagfish: Oh, dear. Seems I'm just one short.
Mr. Krabs: [looks at her] No way, granny!
Madame Hagfish: Oh, But it's all I have. Please...
Squidward: Nope.
Madame Hagfish: Oh please.
SpongeBob: [crying] How sad.
Madame Hagfish: Please, Oh, please...
SpongeBob: [Whispers to the Hagfish]
Madame Hagfish: [gasps. slithers to the door] You haven't seen the last of me!!!! [leaves]
Mr. Krabs: Well, I've certainly seen enough [laughs].
Squidward: What a creepy old hagfish, I thought she'd never leave.
Mr. Krabs: Aye, good job there, SpongeBob. Say, what did you tell here that finally drove her out? I may need to know in case she ever comes back [laughs].
SpongeBob: [begins laughing along] Need to know in case she ever- [laughs again].
SpongeBob: [leaving] Have a good night, Mr. Krabs.
Mr. Krabs: Oh, you too, SpongeBob. Have a good- [notices something in SpongeBob's pants]...night?
