[SpongeBob enters the Krusty Krab.]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, you're late! Don't you know what a watch is?
SpongeBob: Sure I do, Mr. Krabs. Watch this! [juggles some Krabby Patty ingredients] Watch that! [looks through the telescope] Watch me! [pulls out his eyes] Watch us! [holds a miniature SpongeBob] Watch your step! [points to Squidward with his foot in the bucket] Watch your head! [to a customer as he hits his head with a hook] Watch where you're going! [to Plankton as he was trying to steal the formula while in his police officer outfit] Watch this! [removes the tablecloth and various things are flying]
Patrick: SpongeBob, watch out!
[Everything falls on SpongeBob.]
SpongeBob: Watch out! That's a good one, Patrick! [laughs]
