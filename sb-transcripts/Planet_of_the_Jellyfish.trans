[SpongeBob catches three jellyfish in his net]
SpongeBob: Weee! Gotchya! There you go, little fella. [to Patrick] Say, Patrick. Don't you think that Jellyfish Fields has gotten bigger today?
Patrick: I don't know, but all of this failure is tiring me out. I'm just gonna take a nap on that rock right over there.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick. I'll go see if there are any jellyfish in that creepy, scary, evil-looking cave over there.
[Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord is shown]
SpongeBob: [Catches a jellyfish] Aw. You're the charms. If only you didn't sting, you'd make the perfect pet! [Jellyfish stings SpongeBob] Oh, well! I guess it's catch and release for now.
[Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord catches a jellyfish and turns it into a Jellien; soon the Overlord makes more Jelliens. Patrick is shown sleeping. The Jellien engulfs Patrick's entire body and creates a Jellien Patrick. Some Jellien's take the real Patrick away. Tentacles extend out of Jellien Patrick's mouth and place Patrick's jellyfish net in Jellien Patrick into his hand]
SpongeBob: [steps in front of Patrick] Isn't he the cutest little jellyfish you've ever seen. [picks up Jellien jellyfish by the stingers] And he doesn't sting.
[Jellien Patrick captures numerous jellyfish in his net]
SpongeBob: [looking at Jellien jellyfish] You don't suppose this is some sort of new breed, huh? [places Jellien jellyfish back into net] I think I'll keep this one as a pet. [spots Patrick's overfilled net] Whoa!
Jellien Patrick: Yes. I too have caught many jellyfish. [holding up index finger] Perhaps we shall give one to each of our friends. [grins and breaths heavily]
SpongeBob: Wow, Patrick! That's a great idea.
[Bubble transition to Squidward's house at night]
SpongeBob: Well, we've given a jellyfish to everyone, except Squidward. I'm sure he doesn't want one.
Jellien Patrick: He will take one and like it. [shoves the Jellien into the mail slot. The Jellien creates a clone] Pleasant dreams, square one.
SpongeBob: Hah, back at ya good buddy. [Jellien Squidward is behind him]
Jellien Squidward: Don't let the bed bugs bite. Ha ha ha.
SpongeBob: Um, that's some good advice. Good night, Squidward.
Jellien Squidward: There will be plenty of biting this night. RAH!
[Bubble transition]
SpongeBob: [To Jellien] Tonight, you'll sleep with me little jelly. Goodnight, jellyfish. Goodnight, Gary! Heh, good night little jelly. [SpongeBob sleeps. The Jellien tries to climb on SpongeBob, but he wakes up] Ah, I can't sleep. [walks downstairs. The Jellien follows him. SpongeBob is watching a horror film and eating popcorn. The Jellien tries to climb on SpongeBob again, but he screams he laughs nervously]” These late-night horror shows are a real hoot. “[The Jellien tries to climb on him, once again] Oh, you want some popcorn? Here ya go. [tosses popcorn into the Jellien's mouth, causing it to choke] Hey, hey! Are you okay back there?
[Bubble transition to morning. The Jellien is shown sleeping]
SpongeBob: Aw, look at him, the little angel. Guess he couldn't make it past the third feature. [picks up the Jellien] Good morning sleepy-head. We wouldn't want anything to happen to you while I'm at work. [puts the Jellien in a cage] You better stay in here where it's safe. [pats Gary's shell] You two stay out of trouble, bye!
[SpongeBob leaves his house and Gary takes a nap near a plant. The Jellien then eats Gary and the plant at the same time creating Jellien Gary, which looks like Gary mixed with a plant. Bubble transition to SpongeBob walking into the Krusty Krab] 
SpongeBob: Whoa! Look at all of the customers!
Jellien Clone: One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise.
Jellien Squidward: One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise.
Jellien Patrick: [holds out a tray with a Krabby Patty] One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise.
Jellien Squidward: [takes the tray with the Krabby Patty and gives it to the Jellien Clone] Thank you, come again.
Jellien Clone and Jellien Squidward: Rah!
[The next customer, who appears normal walks up]
Martin: I would like one Krabby Pat-
Jellien Squidward: [takes out another Krabby Patty] One Krabby Patty, hold the mayonnaise. RAH!
Martin: Ugh. Actually I want one with extra mayo!
[Jellien Squidward and the rest of the Jellien Clones begin hissing and pointing at the lone, normal fish]
Martin: W-what's wrong, dudes?
Jellien Mr. Krabs: [comes out of Mr. Krabs' office] I'm sorry, valued customer. We are currently out of the condiment you call mayonnaise. [takes out a Jellien] Please accept this free jellyfish hat instead! [puts the Jellien on the normal fish's head] Thank you, come again! [leaves]
SpongeBob: [looks confused] Huh? That's funny. We just received a whole shipment of mayonnaise. [walks to the back and spots Jellien Patrick] Patrick?!? What are you doing? Cooking Krabby Patties is my job.
Jellien Patrick: I am here to replace you and all of your kind!
SpongeBob: [laughs] I saw that movie last night, too. Whoops! If you're going work here, you're going to need an official Krusty Krab hat.
Jellien Patrick: Hat? [grows a Krusty Krab hat on his head]
SpongeBob: Say, that's a pretty neat trick! I'm going to get some extra mayonnaise from the back.
Jellien Patrick: [quickly turns around with his torso still facing the grill] No mayonnaise! [uses his mouth tentacles to eat the Krabby Patty SpongeBob was holding then turns back around to cook more Patties]
SpongeBob: O...kay? [walks into the freezer] He's acting weird today. [spots the boxes of mayonnaise] Hey! There's plenty of mayo back here! [hears a strange noise] Huh? Is somebody in there? [looks into the back and spots the Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord, Jelliens, and all of the citizens trapped in pods] Monsters! Huh? Squidward and Mr. Krabs! Patrick, too! [spots Harold] And some random guy! Huh? [screams] My spatula! It's just like that movie I watched last night! Those things have captured everyone and put them into creepy pods. [walks out of the freezer, nervously walking past Jellien Patrick] Hi, uh, Patrick? I gotta...clean the tables...Patrick. Ha ha...Patrick. [walks out backwards with Jellien Squidward then surprising him]
Jellien Squidward: Hi, SpongeBob! Don't you want this cute little jellyfish? [the Jellien then hisses at SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Ha ha...uh, no thanks. [continues walking backwards and bumps into Jellien Mr. Krabs] Ah! Mr. Krabs!
Jellien Mr. Krabs: You seem tired, SpongeBob. Why don't you go home and take a nap? [hisses strangely at SpongeBob]
Jellien Squidward: [still holding a Jellien] Yes, and you can use this jelly as a pillow.
SpongeBob: Oh, that's okay. I-I have one at home. Hah... [continues walking backwards until he is scared off by more Jellien Clones until he reaches the door]
Jellien Squidward and Jellien Mr. Krabs: Sleep well.
SpongeBob: [continues walking backwards until he bumps into Jellien Harold]
Jellien Harold: Re-
SpongeBob: Ah! Random guy! [starts running from a bunch of Jelliens, until he loses them by hiding behind a rock] What am I going to do? All of my friends taken by those Jelly creatures. I can feel their creepy, rope-like tentacles now! [suddenly is roped and drag into Sandy's treedome and is locked down]
Sandy: Alright, you rotten jelly clone! What have you done with SpongeBob?!
SpongeBob: I'm no clone, Sandy! I am SpongeBob!
Sandy: Then you won't mind if I run a simple test. [starts tickling him and he starts laughing hysterically] You're SpongeBob, alright...
[Bubble transition to where SpongeBob is free]
SpongeBob: What are we going to do, Sandy?
Sandy: If only we knew the Jellien's weakness.
SpongeBob: Well, the only thing I know is that they can't stand mayonnaise.
Sandy: Ew, I don't like mayonnaise neither.
SpongeBob: [looks suspiciously at Sandy] Oh, so you don't like mayo? Just like a Jellien!
Sandy: [smacks SpongeBob] Oh, snap out of it, SpongeBob! Now if only we had some mayonnaise.
SpongeBob: There's lot at the Krusty Krab! But we'll never get past them! [points to a bunch of Jellien Clones just outside the dome]
Sandy: Not to worry! [takes out glasses that looks like the Jellien's eyes] We'll be in disguise.
[They both walk outside the dome whistling as they walk up to a Jellien Clone]
Sandy: Greetings, fellow clone. I hate mayonnaise.
SpongeBob: I hate mayonnaise and mustard.
Jellien Fred: [looks suspiciously at SpongeBob] Hmm...
[SpongeBob and Sandy both walk off whistling]
Jellien Fred: I like mustard!
[They both walk into the Krusty Krab and meet up with Jellien Mr. Krabs]
Jellien Mr. Krabs: Did you take that nap, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Uh huh! Sure did!
Sandy: Yep. We're all rested and jelly-fied.
SpongeBob: [laughs nervously and elbows Sandy accidentally knocking off her Jellien glasses] Good one, Jellien Sandy.
Sandy: [laughs nervously]
Jellien Mr. Krabs: Imposters!
[All of the Jellien Clones in the Krusty Krab begin hissing and surrounding SpongeBob and Sandy]
Sandy: SpongeBob! The mayonnaise!
SpongeBob: [leaps up high and swings over to the condiment stand and grabs a jug of mayonnaise, then squirts one at Jellien Mr. Krabs]
Jellien Mr. Krabs: Ah! [the mayonnaise lands on him] Ew... [he then disintegrates which frees the real Mr. Krabs from his pod]
Sandy: It worked, SpongeBob! Keep going!
SpongeBob: [squirts Jellien Squidward who tried to attack him with mayonnaise destroying him and freeing Squidward in the process].
Sandy: SpongeBob! Look out!
[All of the Jellien Clones begin to close in to which SpongeBob squirts and destroys all of them. SpongeBob and Sandy then head towards the back running past Jellien Patrick]
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Jellien Patrick!
Jellien Patrick: Hold the mayonnaise!
SpongeBob: D'oh! Almost forgot! [squirts Jellien Patrick with the mayonnaise, causing him to disintegrate and frees Patrick from his pod]
Patrick: [wakes up and falls on his neck] D'oh! Hey guys! What's shaking? [Squidward nervously points to the Evil Alien Jellyfish Overlord and Patrick realizes the situation] Oh...
[SpongeBob and Sandy enter the freezer to confront the Overlord]
Sandy: Hold it right there, you evil blob of slime! You're through 'cause we know your weakness! Show 'em, SpongeBob!
[SpongeBob shows the Overlord the jug of mayonnaise. The Overlord then roars loudly telling the Jelliens to attack SpongeBob and Sandy]
Sandy: Let 'er rip!
SpongeBob: [starts squirting the Jelliens until the jug of mayonnaise starts to act up] Nah! Gasp! Sandy! It's so cold in here the mayonnaise is starting to freeze!
Sandy: Then hurry and throw it, SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Aye, aye! [unscrews the lid of the jug of mayonnaise and hurls it at the Overlord, but it freezes and lands on its head. Then it laughs at SpongeBob's failure] Oh no! This mayonnaise is frozen solid!
Sandy: [next to a thermostat] Then I'll just turn up the heat! [turns the thermostat from "COLD" to "HOT", causing the mayonnaise to melt on the Overlord's head, thus destroying him and all of the Jelliens]
SpongeBob and Sandy: Hooray!
Mr. Krabs: What happened?
SpongeBob: Well, let me tell ya!
Narrator: Eleven minutes later...
SpongeBob: And that's why we're covered in goo!
Mr. Krabs: Thanks for rescuing us, SpongeBob. But what are we going to do with all of this green slop?
Patrick: [tastes the green goo] Mmm! Freaky Clone Jelly Relish!
[Bubble transition to the Krusty Krab again]
Mr. Krabs: Relish Patties! Get your Freaky Clone Jelly Relish Patties! Only four bucks extra!
Patrick: [to Squidward] Uh, I'll have one Relish Patty. Hold the mayo.
[SpongeBob looks suspiciously at Patrick with the next time card saying "The End?", ending the episode]
