[opening shot of the Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [singing] ♪Krabby Patties, Krabby Patties, love cookin' me some Krabby Patties! Feedin' all the children and the mommies and the daddies! Love servin' up the most delicious dish, but before I can, gotta add a little of this!♪ [takes tartar sauce bottle but it's empty] Hmm, time to refill the tartar sauce. [goes to a large tartar sauce bucket but it's empty] Empty! I thought I'd never see the day. "Use on or before the date printed below." [gasps] This can has been here for 50 years. That's longer than me! Oh, important Krusty Krab relic, what shall we do with ye?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob, throw that trash out and get back to work!
SpongeBob: Trash? Oh, but, Mr. Krabs, this should be in a museum for future generations to enjoy.
Mr. Krabs: [gets an idea] Hmm. Future generations, huh?
[Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: Welcome to the Krusty Krab Time Capsule Spectacular! That's right! In 50 years, your donated treasures will be honored for future generations to enjoy! [to SpongeBob and Squidward] All right, you guys got donations covered, right?
SpongeBob: Sir, yes, sir!
Squidward: Whatever.
Mr. Krabs: I'm gonna go ahead and take care of souvenirs!
[Nat brings a toaster]
SpongeBob: The peoples of the future must see this, so they will know how we toasted bread in the before time. So that they can understand the...
Squidward: Garbage. That'll be a $5 contribution fee. [SpongeBob puts the toaster in the time capsule]
Mr. Krabs: And there's your commemorative time capsule key chain. That'll be $49.57.
Billy: But, this thing's made out of rusty old paper clips and cardboard!
Mr. Krabs: All right. You drive a hard bargain. I'll throw in a coupon for one free ice cube in a purchase of any large cola at the Krusty Krab. What do ya say?
Billy: [takes coupon] Deal!
[Mr. Krabs puts the money away in his shell and sighs]
[Sadie brings a lamp]
SpongeBob: What a beautiful lamp, ma'am, so ornate, essential for night time reading.
Sadie: Why, thank you, young man!
Squidward: No, thank you for completely failing our future generations with your donation. I mean, seriously, ma'am, did you just grab the first thing you saw this morning?
Sadie: Well, actually..
Squidward: [imitates Sadie] "Hmm. Oh, whatever will I donate to the time capsule? Golly, this is hard! How about [gasps] this lamp?! It's [sarcastically] perfect!"
Sadie: Wow, you're good. How did you know all that? Are you like a psychic? Oh, oh, oh! Tell me what I'm thinking!
Squidward: Next. [throws the lamp]
SpongeBob: [catches the lamp in his face] Hey, nice pass, Squidward!
[Bubble transition; a strange man brings a plate]
Squidward: Uh-huh. Tell me, what do you know about this plate?
Man: Uh, it works good when I eat stuff.
Squidward: Right. This plate is actually not meant to be eaten on. Now with your permission, I'd like to perform a few tests to verify its authenticity.
Man: Uh, okay.
Squidward: [starts teething on plate. Sucks it up his nose and takes it out] Uh-huh. [rubs it on his bottom] Interesting. [skids around on plate] This is a promising sign. Yep. [hits plate on man's head several times] You hear that plate-hitting-skull sound? It's definitely authentic. And I would price it conservatively in today's market at $250.
Man: Really?
Squidward: No. [throws plate away and SpongeBob catches it; he breaths heavily]
[Bubble transition]
SpongeBob: [to the plate] You are the crown jewel of the time capsule!
Squidward: Next. [throws sock]
SpongeBob: [gasps. He catches the sock and drops the plate, breaking it] A four-striped sock! Incredible!
French Narrator: 2 hours later...
SpongeBob: Okay, Squidward. I think that's everyone.
Patrick: [runs to the time capsule with a rock] SpongeBob! SpongeBob, did I make it? I brought my favorite rock to donate to the time thinger.
SpongeBob: Ooh, are you sure you can part with it, Patrick?
Patrick: Sometimes you've got to make sacrifices.
SpongeBob: After you then!
Patrick: Thank you, my good man.
Squidward: Sorry, Patrick, but there's no way I'm letting you put your dumb rock in the time capsule. I've allowed some seriously ridiculous items today, but this is where I draw the line. Do you unders...? [Patrick is gone] What t-..
Patrick: Okay, Rocky, you're going bye-bye now.
Squidward: Oh, no, you don't! [Squidward and Patrick fight over the rock and the rock falls on a wooden floorboard and it catapults SpongeBob, Patrick, and Squidward into the time capsule, which closes]
SpongeBob: You know, that didn't hurt as bad as I thought it would.
Patrick: What didn't? Hey, look, a yo-yo! [plays with yo-yo]
SpongeBob: Patrick, you're very good at that!
[Bubble transition]
Mr. Krabs: And thanks so much for all your contributions! So, are ya ready to put this thing in the ground?! [crowd cheers]
Plankton: Ugh! Curse that Krabs and his cheering crowds! Big whoop, a stupid time capsule. [blows raspberry]
Mr. Krabs: But, before we do, I'd like to make a contribution of my own. A copy of the Krabby Patty formula!
Plankton: [eye becomes bottle-shaped and antennae snap] There it is! The one element that can turn this lonesome bucket of steel into a bustling world famous eatery! [laughs evilly]
Mr. Krabs: [puts the formula in the time capsule] Send her down! [the time capsule gets buried]
SpongeBob: [throws a card in a net] He shoots, he scores!
Squidward: [shoves SpongeBob off] Get off me! [tries to get out]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward, whatcha doing?
Patrick: Yeah, it looks fun!
Squidward: We just got buried alive, you idiots!
SpongeBob: I know, but what are you doing?
[Bubble Transition]
[everyone cheering]
Mr. Krabs: Who's ready to eat some Krabby Patties, 'cause all that waiting in line's got you super hungry? [crowd cheers. Everyone enters the Krusty Krab as Plankton laughs evilly]
[scene cuts to time capsule]
SpongeBob: Hmm. What should we do for the next 50 years?
Patrick: I'm just gonna hang here for a while, maybe get a kelp soda later.
SpongeBob: Patrick, you can't go anywhere. We're trapped down here till they open that capsule in 50 years.
Patrick: [shocked] 50 years? What are we gonna do till then?
SpongeBob: I don't know. We've got 50 years' worth of stuff to play with here! [finds a game. He gasps] It's our favorite game!
Both: Pretzel Pals!
Patrick: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! [lays the game out on Squidward]
SpongeBob: Yes, yes, now where did we leave off?
Patrick: I believe my left hand was on red.
SpongeBob: My right foot was on blue.
Patrick: Forehead on yellow.
SpongeBob: Left foot on green. [kicks Squidward in the face. He throws the game off him and on SpongeBob and Patrick
