[pans over live-action houses]
Narrator: And now, direct from Encino, America's favorite pirate and president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club, Patchy the Pirate. [The exterior of Patchy's house is shown. The name "Patchy" appears. Inside, Patchy is wrapping presents]
Patchy:  [to the tune of "Jingle Bells"] Yo ho ho, yo ho ho, yo ho ho ho ho ho. [he notices he's on air] Oh! Hi. [he waves] I'm Patchy the Pirate, president of the SpongeBob SquarePants fan club! [He notices a long piece of confetti on his hook and tries to shake it off. He pulls on it and whacks himself in the eye, giving him a black eye. He switches his patch over to the other eye] Hey, that's better! [Potty, a puppet bird on strings, flies in]
Potty: [squawks] Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas!
Patchy: That's right, Potty! It is Christmas. [he limps over to the fireplace] And there ain't nothing better in the seven seas than a Bikini Bottom Christmas. It sure is a magical time of year. [he blows on his pipe, and bubbles emerge] Why, I'll bet old SpongeBob is gearing up for Santa Claus right now! [He picks up a picture of SpongeBob. Cuts to SpongeBob, holding a remote]
SpongeBob: I sure am! [He presses a button on the remote. A large chimney rises from the ground next to his house, and a gigantic funnel pops out of it with the words "Welcome Santa" in neon letters] I'm ready! [Patchy laughs]
Patchy: Not bad for a creature with no vertebrae. [he puts down SpongeBob's picture] And I'm sure our pal Patrick is doing his share of the decorating. [He picks up a picture of Patrick. Cuts to Patrick standing by his house with a dopey smile on his face. Zooms out to reveal a single ornament hanging from the antenna on top of his rock. It snaps off and hits the ground, and Patrick does the same as well. Now, Patchy is mixing cookie dough] I too am also preparing for Christmas. [he lifts up the mixer] Hmm, unbaked cookie dough! [he takes a lick] Mmm...
Potty: [squawks] Potty want cookie dough! [he flies over, squawking] Cookie! [Patchy ducks]
Patchy: Potty! No! [Potty flies back and forth]
Potty: Cookie! [squawks]
Patchy: Get out of here!
Potty: Cookie!
Patchy: Potty!
Potty: [squawks] Give us a lick!
Patchy: Back off, you flying freak! [Potty flies on the counter]
Potty: [squawks] Clarify please.
Patchy: [the cookies are shaped like SpongeBob and Patrick] This here cookie dough is for the children, not for pesky parrots. [Cuts to Hans reaching over and ringing a bell. Patchy looks out the window] What's that? Three bells! Well, we all know what three bells means!
Children: [off-screen] Free ice cream! [Patchy laughs]
Patchy: No, you silly livers. [sternly] No!
Potty: [squawks] Man overboard? [Patchy walks over to a desk]
Patchy: You, I'm ignoring. [he sits down] No, it's time to open fan letters! [Potty flies over with a letter in his beak]
Potty: [squawks] Here you go! [Patchy tugs at it]
Patchy: Thank you, Potty. [Potty is not letting go] Yeah. Okay Potty, thank you! [Potty squawks, still not letting go] Come on, give it, you birdbrain! [Potty squawks some more] Quiet, infernal bird! [He uses his hook, now with a pair of scissors on the end, to snip Potty's rope. Potty squawks and falls to the ground. Patchy nods] Hmm. [he sits back down] This letter comes to us from...
Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy tears the envelope open, pieces of it flying all over. He pulls up his eye patch and replaces it with a pair of reading glasses with one eye covered up]
Patchy: And he writes, "Dear SpongeBob, I am ten years old, and I was wondering if you like Christmas as much as I do. Sincerely yours..."
Fish Head: [as voiceover] Name and address withheld! [Patchy gets up and takes off his glasses. Now his eye patch is back on]
Patchy: A very good question. But you know they didn't always celebrate Christmas in Bikini Bottom.
Potty: [squawks] They didn't?
Patchy: No sir, my fine feathered little neck pain. [He pulls down Potty's strings. Potty, as well as his puppeteer, falls to the ground. Patchy hangs a homemade SpongeBob ornament on a Christmas tree. Zooms out, showing the entire tree, which is decorated with many similar SpongeBob, as well as ornaments featuring Patrick and Squidward, and a few gift boxes] There was a time when no one had even heard of Christmas in Bikini Bottom. [he snaps his fingers] Hey! Who wants to hear the story of SpongeBob's very first Christmas? [Cuts to Potty, who looks very drowsy and with bloodshot eyes. Patchy turns around] Potty? [he sees an empty bowl of cookie dough, accompanied by a foghorn noise] You ate all me cookie dough! [Potty is now incredibly fat. The whole lower half of his body, along with his strings, fall off, leaving only his head]
Potty: Squ-ouch! [Patchy shrugs]
Patchy: Oh, well. On with the show.
[After the title card and opening credits, SpongeBob is shown waiting on a hill near Sandy's treedome, wearing karate gloves]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Today, I'm gonna sneak up and get that Sandy with a super sneaky karate move. [practices karate and sneaks over to Sandy's door as Sandy hums "Jingle Bells"]
SpongeBob: What diabolical act is she committing now? [Sandy plugs in Christmas lights outside her tree and SpongeBob freaks out] Fire! Don't worry, Sandy, I'm coming! Stand back, Sandy, fire! [rushes inside and instead of throwing water on tree, he throws it on Sandy] Huh? So I guess there's no fire?
Sandy: What in the name of the Alamo is wrong with you, SpongeBob? Ain't you never seen a Christmas tree before?
SpongeBob: Christmas who?
Sandy: What?! Y'all never heard of Christmas?
SpongeBob: Is she a friend from Texas?
Sandy: [laughs] No. I can't believe you haven't heard of... [makes an adorable face] ...Christmas.
SpongeBob: Tell me more about this... [imitates Sandy] ..."Christmas."
Patchy: And so, Sandy wove the magical tale of gumdrops and pennywhistles. She told of toy-making elves and flying reindeer. But best of all, she told of the one they call, Santa Claus. [SpongeBob's eyes widen]
[The next day at The Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: [standing on a table towards Squidward, Patrick and Mr. Krabs] And everyone pretends to like the fruitcake.
Squidward: Yawn.
SpongeBob: But the best part is you can write a letter to this guy, Santa Claus, and tell him what you want, and when he comes he brings it to you.
Patrick: Just like a genie. [laughs]
Mr. Krabs: I dunno about you, lubbers, but any fella who's giving away free stuff, is a friend o' mine.
SpongeBob: That's the spirit, Mr. Krabs. [grabs a piece of paper and pencil] Here you go! You can get started on your letter.
Squidward: I can't believe anybody would celebrate a holiday where a jolly prowler breaks into your house and leaves gifts.
Patrick: Like a genie.
Mr. Krabs: Pipe down, Squidward. I'm trying to concentrate. This thing is as good as a blank check direct from the First National Bank of Santa Claus.
Squidward: Oh, brother.
Patrick: Yeah.
SpongeBob: Okay, who's next?
Patrick: Ooh, ooh, me, me!
Squidward: Ooh.
SpongeBob: Here you go, Patrick.
Patrick: There's no words on this paper.
SpongeBob: Not yet.
Patrick: [grabs a pencil] Yippee! A writing stick.
SpongeBob: C'mon, Squidward. Write a letter.
Squidward: SpongeBob, grow up will ya? No one's going to give me a gift just because I write them a stupid letter. [Patrick's letter tears in half]
Patrick: SpongeBob, I ripped my paper. Could I have another one?
SpongeBob: Sure, buddy. Here you go. Okie dokie, Squid... [Patrick rips his again] ...ward.
Patrick: Uhh, SpongeBob... [hands him another piece] Thanks. [sits down and starts writing with the paper on top of the pencil] Dear Sant... [paper rips] D'oh! Not again.
SpongeBob: Here, Patrick, watch me. [starts to write] Dear Santa, what do I want for Christmas, you may ask? All I want is for you to visit gentle folk here in Bikini Bottom. That is my wish. [puts the letter in a bottle] Patrick, I designed this mechanism specifically to shoot bottles to the surface. The hopes of everyone rests on the success of its maiden voyage. Fire in the hole!
[presses it and the bottle shoots up to the surface]
Patrick: Santa! Haha. Where's Santa?
SpongeBob: Santa doesn't come till Christmas Eve.
Mr. Krabs: Okay boy, my demands, uhh, I mean, my letter, is ready to go.
SpongeBob: Great, Mr. Krabs. What did you wish for?
Mr. Krabs: A pony.
SpongeBob: Really?
Mr. Krabs: With saddle bags full of money! [shoots a bottle up to the surface]
Patrick: Here you go, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: What did you wish for, Patrick?
Patrick: Another piece of paper. [bottle shoots up to the surface]
SpongeBob: And what did you wish for, little girl?
Susie: Front teeth!
Cowboy: I could use a new hat!
Jennifer-Millie: I need a new hairstyle!
Lonnie: I'd like a glass of water for my teeth.
[lots of bottles get shot up to the surface]
Squidward: Excuse me, coming through, out of the way.
SpongeBob: Great, Squidward, you finished. What's your wish?
Squidward: My wish is that the people of Bikini Bottom will stop paying any attention to the inane dribble that is constantly streaming out of this dunderhead's mouth.
SpongeBob: Gee, Squidward, maybe Santa will bring me a dictionary so I can understand what you just said. Okay, everybody, we've got a lot to do now that we've summoned Santa Claus. We must ready ourselves for his arrival.
Everyone: Hooray!
