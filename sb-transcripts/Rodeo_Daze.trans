Narrator: Ah, the eternal expanse of the deep sea. Teeming with fantastic creatures. Uh, teeming… I’m sure they’re around here somewhere! Aha! [Zooms in on a rock with bugs on it] Oh, that’s a rock! Where is everybody? [screams] [SpongeBob is right there, and he scared the narrator] Oh, it is just SpongeBob. Watch and witness one of the rarest and mysterious rituals of the deep, the staring contest. [SpongeBob and Patrick are having a staring contest]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob’s eyes get watery and he finally blinks] Patrick, wow!
Patrick: What?
SpongeBob: You are the best starer I’ve ever stared at!
Patrick: Oh, staring contest! I thought it was a blinking contest and I was losing.
SpongeBob: [There is a sound like something is falling] Hark, Patrick. Do you hear something? [A message in a bottle falls on SpongeBob’s head, and SpongeBob falls down] Oh! [SpongeBob reads the note tied to the bottle] Hmm, it’s a letter for Sandy, all the way from Texas. We better deliver it!
[Scene cuts to Sandy’s treedome]
SpongeBob: Sandy! [SpongeBob tries to open Sandy’s door, but it doesn’t open] Oh, it’s not opening!
Patrick: Hey, SpongeBob! I have something that might help. [Patrick pulls out a book called ‘How to Open Things’]
SpongeBob: How to open things. Brilliant, Patrick! I saw the movie, but I never read the book.
Patrick: Uh, ok. [Patrick flips through the pages] Garbage cans. No. Jar. No. Box. No. Sandy’s door! Twist to the left.
SpongeBob: Oh! I was twisting to the right.
Patrick: A common mistake, my good friend. [Patrick puts away the book] Allow me. [Patrick does some warm up exercises] Ok, time to open this.
Sandy: [Sandy kicks her door open] Hi-yah! Trying to ninja sneak attack? Hi-yah! Hi-yah! [Sandy kicks Patrick up in the air, and she hits SpongeBob, causing the note in the bottle on SpongeBob’s head to fall out] Well, you’re still no match for my squirrel-fu! [Sandy grabs the note and reads it] It’s a letter from my twin brother, Randy!
SpongeBob: [Patrick falls on SpongeBob] Oh!
Sandy: [SpongeBob and Patrick get into Sandy’s suit] Do you mind?
SpongeBob: Not at all. Read on.
Patrick: Doesn’t bother me.
Sandy: Get out of my suit! [SpongeBob and Patrick are flushed out of Sandy’s suit] Well, golly! Randy says the rodeo’s come to town. I’ve got to head back to Texas and defend my championship title!
SpongeBob: Championship title? For what?
Sandy: You got cotton in your ears?
Patrick: [Patrick looks in SpongeBob’s ear] Hmm, no. It’s not cotton. It’s actually an old moldy piece of Krabby Patty. [Patrick eats the Krabby patty] Mmm.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob is holding a jellyfish net] Is your championship title for jellyfishing?
Sandy: No.
SpongeBob: Karate? [SpongeBob hits Patrick in the face]
Sandy: No!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob and Patrick are now wearing white coats and glasses, and Patrick is holding a mini volcano] Perhaps the science fair, then.
Sandy: No. It’s my rodeo championship on the line.
SpongeBob: Rodeo? What does rodeo mean?
Sandy: ♪Critters that you gotta wrangle.♪ [Sandy pulls out a lasso and lassos SpongeBob and Patrick] ♪Cowboy suits with perty spangles.♪ [Sandy is now wearing spangles on her suit and she is wearing cowboy boots and a cowboy hat] ♪Boots with spurs that jingle jangle, that's a rodeo. Tight blue jeans you gotta squeeze in, but they sure look mighty pleasin'!♪ [Sandy gives Patrick a wedgie by putting some jeans on him.] ♪Big belt buckles are always in season!♪ [SpongeBob is wearing a big belt buckle] ♪That's a rodeo.♪

Sandy: ♪And don’t forget who makes us laugh when we’re feelin’ down. The happy slappy, sunny, funny good ol’ rodeo clown.♪ [Sandy puts on a clown suit]
SpongeBob: Clowns? [SpongeBob grabs onto Sandy] Don’t go, Sandy! It’s too risky!
Sandy: [pushes SpongeBob away] I must! It’s my duty! [Sandy’s suit turns into a rocket and Sandy rockets out of the water]
SpongeBob: Oh, this is terrible! We can’t let Sandy go all alone! It’s too dangerous up there, right Patrick?
Patrick: Eh, I’m indifferent.
SpongeBob: How could we live with ourselves if Sandy got hurt, and we weren’t there to help? Why, I wouldn’t be able to look at myself.
Patrick: Look at yourself? How do you do that? [Patrick spins around, trying to look at himself]
SpongeBob: Patrick! This is no time for silly games! Sandy needs us. You understand? Patrick? Patrick!
Patrick: [runs away, thinking about the wedgie.] No more tight jeans!
SpongeBob: Oh, I’m sure someone else will help me.
[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs’ office in The Krusty Krab]
SpongeBob: So there you have it, Mr. Krabs. Sandy really needs our help.
Mr. Krabs: Okay, explain it to me again, but this time, take out anything that doesn’t have to do with money. Uh-huh, that’s what I thought. [Mr. Krabs walks away]
SpongeBob: [sigh] I need to find someone with compassion. Someone who selflessly helps others, with no concern for his own safety. I need…A hero.
[Scene cuts to Squidward’s front yard, where Squidward it sunbathing]
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward! Sandy is in terrible trouble. You’ve got to help me save her!
Squidward: Oh, no! Sally’s in trouble!
SpongeBob: Uh, Sandy.
Squidward: Don’t worry, SpongeBob. Just wait right here. [Squidward walks towards his house] I’ll get my emergency squirrel rescue kit!
SpongeBob: Right-o, Mr. Tentacles, sir!
Squidward: Just don’t panic! [Squidward goes in his house and slams the door, then he climbs out the back window and walks away]
SpongeBob: Ooh uh. Well, there’s one last person I can ask.
[Scene cuts to The Chum Bucket]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob bangs on the door] Plankton!
Plankton: [Plankton opens the door and comes out] What?
SpongeBob: Sandy’s in trouble. I need help rescuing her.
Plankton: [Plankton gets some dynamite with a timer on it] I’m kind of busy right now.
SpongeBob: Jeepers, it’ll only take a minute.
Plankton: Yeah, uh, I’d love to help, but I really got to go. [Plankton picks up the dynamite and carries it towards The Krusty Krab, and the dynamite blows up before Plankton gets to The Krusty Krab] Ouch.
SpongeBob: Ugh. Well, I’m going to go save Sandy, whether anyone wants to help or not.
[Scene cuts to SpongeBob’s room]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob packs his suitcase] I guess it’s just you and me, Gary. [SpongeBob tries to pack Gary, but Gary doesn’t let go of the floor] Let’s go. Gary the snail! Do you plan on staying here while Sandy is possibly in trouble somewhere up there?
Gary: Meow meow meow?
SpongeBob: She’s the squirrel.
Gary: Meow?
SpongeBob: No, brown. Gary, what does that have to do [Gary leaves] You too, huh? Well, we’ll see about that! [SpongeBob pulls out some bubble soap. Scene changes to nighttime]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob opens his bubble soap and blows a bubble to capture Gary. Scene cuts to Squidward’s front yard]
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blows a bubble that goes in Squidward’s window, and captures Squidward, then SpongeBob blows a bubble that goes in Patrick’s house and capture’s Patrick]
Patrick: Eh, pudding.
[Scene cuts to Mr. Krabs house, where a bubble is blown to capture Mr. Krabs. Scene cuts to Bikini Bottom, where a lot of Bikini Bottomites are captured by bubbles. Scene cuts to SpongeBob’s house, where everyone that was captured by bubbles is] 
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob blows a bubble capturing his alarm clock which goes off, popping all the bubbles]
Everyone inside a bubble: [screaming]
SpongeBob: Good morning!
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! What’s the meaning of this?
SpongeBob: Sandy’s in trouble, and I need all of your help to save her from the horrors of the rodeo! There are clowns there!
Squidward: SpongeBob, the next time you ‘invite’ me to one of your slumber parties, I’m calling the cops! [Squidward walks outside, and he falls because SpongeBob’s house is also in a bubble] [screams] Arrgh, Arrgh, oh, oh. What the? SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob falls beside Squidward] Oh. Yes, Squidward?
Everyone who was trapped in a bubble, except Squidward: [They all walk outside, and they fall as well and scream] [The bubble comes out of the water and goes to Texas]
Mr. Krabs: Where the devil are we?
SpongeBob: It's... Texas.
Everyone in the Bubble: [screaming]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: What’s that, boy? You see Sandy?
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: And she’s…riding a bullfrog?
Sandy: [Sandy is riding a bullfrog] Yee-haw!
SpongeBob: Ahoy, Sandy!
Sandy: Huh?
Frog: Ribbit! [The frog bucks Sandy off]
Sandy: Ow. Gall darn it! You sea slickers made me lose the rodeo. Why are you here, anyways?
SpongeBob: To help save you from this rodeo thing!
Sandy: I don’t need to be saved! [gasps] Watch out! That old bullfrog’s got a flea on his flanks, and he’s comin’ right at ya!
Bullfrog: Ribbit, ribbit!
Everyone in the bubble:  [Screaming as they were attacked by the bullfrog, when the bubble pops everyone looks like real sea creatures when they land]
Bullfrog: Ribbit.
Patrick: Did we save Sandy?
SpongeBob: No, Patrick. We didn’t.
Mr. Krabs: Did we make any money?
Gary: Meow.
Sandy: Aw, cactus! That ol’ bullfrog’s got SpongeBob! Hang on, old buddy! [Sandy lassos SpongeBob away from the bullfrog, the crowd cheers] Next time, leave the rodeos to me.
SpongeBob: Aw, nuts. [Iris out.]
