What_if_SpongeBob_Was_Gone%3F_(Patrick)

Narrator: What if SpongeBob was gone?
[scene switches to Jellyfish Fields]
Patrick: Haha. Jellyfish, beware! Patrick Star is here. Jellyfish. Oh, how do you hold this again? [turns net upside-down so he's holding the net side] There. Got ya! [fails, uses the net as a catapult but fails again, throws the net at the jellyfish but can't get one] This isn't over! Hey, I'm not done with you. [a big jellyfish, with the net stuck in it, rises from under the ground] I could really use SpongeBob's jellyfishing expertise right about now.
[scene cuts to black when Patrick is being stunned by big jellyfish]
