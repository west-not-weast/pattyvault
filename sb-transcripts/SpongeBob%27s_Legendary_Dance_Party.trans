Narrator: It's SpongeBob's Legendary Dance Party!
SpongeBob: Hey everybody! It's time to dance!
SpongeBob: Do the cyclops! [pushes his eyes together to form one eye and starts whooing]
Plankton: Ha-ha, I like it.
SpongeBob: Now, do the sea monster! [turns into sea monster and starts roaring]
Patrick: Ooh! [Patrick wants to do a sea monster, but he breaks his back and his back bone pops out] Ow!
SpongeBob: Patrick, are you okay?
Patrick: It's just my new dance move. I'll call it... "the horrible mistake".
