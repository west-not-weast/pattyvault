SpongeBob: [walks around with boxes, then stops, drops the boxes, and gasps] I almost forgot. It's "Surprise Sandy Day." [We see the calendar. One of the dates on it is "Surprise Sandy Day"] The only question is how to surprise her.
[Cut to SpongeBob tunneling to Sandy's treedome. He stops in front of it and sees Sandy writing something on a piece of paper. SpongeBob then knocks on the door. Sandy turns around]
Sandy: Hello? [Flowers drop from the ceiling and land in a vase on the table. Sandy turns around] What in tarnation? [There is a note attached to the flowers. Sandy reads it] "To Sandy, the smartest, prettiest squirrel in Bikini Bottom. Signed, a Friend". [We see SpongeBob giggling on top of the treedome. He jumps down. Sandy somehow sees him] I wonder who it could be from. [SpongeBob runs away. But before he does, he jumps in the air and clicks his heels, happy that Sandy got the message]
