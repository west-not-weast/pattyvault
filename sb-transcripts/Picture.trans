[SpongeBob whistles, when Patrick comes with a portrait]
Patrick: Hey SpongeBob, I painted a picture of you! [puts the portrait on the ground for SpongeBob to see it] Want to see it?
SpongeBob: Hmmm, that's nice Patrick. But it doesn't really look like me.
Patrick: [exclaims and changes SpongeBob's face] Ohhh... Now it does!
[Both of them start laughing. The rest is an advertisement showing toys of The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie on Burger King.]
