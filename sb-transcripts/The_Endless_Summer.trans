SpongeBob: [singing] I'm off to work at the Krusty Krab, frying up patties and blabbity blab! [he stops singing and we see The Krusty Krab with a smoke stack, inside, a car, pumps exhaust through a tube to the ceiling] Huh? That's new. Strange place to park a car. Whatâ€™s this for? [he pulls off the tube and gets tangled in it]
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! You're wasting my precious carbon dioxide!
SpongeBob: Carbon dioxide?
Mr. Krabs: I'm pumpin' it into the atmosphere, boy. Thanks to Global Warming the temperature will soon go through the roof. And then we'll have an endless summer.
SpongeBob: [confused] Why do you want an endless summer, Mr. Krabs?
[they go outside, where there is a swimming pool]
Mr. Krabs: So I can open me latest money make adventure, The Krusty Pool!
SpongeBob: But what about winter sports, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Eh, forget winter, boy, we're talking about sun tanning, hanging 10, and swimming all year long!
SpongeBob: Hmm... The endless summer does sound like fun!
Mr. Krabs: And profitable!
SpongeBob: Fun and profitable! Big business does it again. I just wish it could be the endless summer right now! [gets an idea] Hey!
[cut to Mr. Krabs' office, where he plays with little clay figures]
Toy Mr. Krabs: Oh. Umbrellas are three dollars, sir!
Toy Fish: Oh! What a bargain! I'll give you five! [the plastic figures then melt in his hands]
Mr. Krabs: What? What the- Barnacles! It suddenly got very warm in here! [opening the door] Who turned up the hea...? [he sees 17 cars plugged into tubes like the one from earlier and goes outside] SpongeBob, what are you doing?
SpongeBob: Just throwing another tire on the fire for Global Warming, Mr. Krabs! [laughs] Hey look! It's working! The entire town is heading this way to cool off.
Mr. Krabs: [excitedly] You mean pay off! Hurry SpongeBob, fill the pool, fill the pool!
SpongeBob: Aye aye sir!
Mr. Krabs: Have your money ready folks! The line starts here! [the fish trample Mr. Krabs with only Patrick left] Where's everybody going?
Patrick: We are all moving North! We can't live here anymore! It's too hot!
Mr. Krabs: [solemnly]All me customers have moved to cooler climates.
SpongeBob: Look at the bright side, Mr. Krabs! There won't be a line to go in the pool! [he jumps into the pool, but suddenly the water evaporates] Caaannnooonnnbaaaalll!!! [he slams face-first into the pool] Ouch.
