[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob and Squidward are stuffing a large garbage bag with trash.]
Squidward: You're just filthy trash! Get in the bag! Filthy trash! [shoves trash in the bag with SpongeBob, but gets splattered with goop] Gah! Trash juice!
SpongeBob: Hey, uh, maybe we should use another garbage bag, Mr. Krabs. This one's kinda full.
Mr. Krabs: Forget it, boy-o. I'm not paying for another garbage bag. Just put your back into it.
SpongeBob: Back, eh? Like this? [flops himself on the trash with his back]
Squidward: Oh, let me help you with that. [jumps on SpongeBob and stomps on him in the trash]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Let me try.
[SpongeBob scoops up a blob of trash, throws it in the air and throws his eyes, mouth, nose, arms and legs to form a trash-like body of himself. SpongeBob and Squidward jump up and down on the trash.]
SpongeBob: Whee!
Mr. Krabs: Keep it up! It's working! [cackles]
SpongeBob: Keeping it up, Mr. Krabs. [jumps really high] Hi-yah! [jumps down really hard on the trash]
[Dave gets up from the table after eating his meal, sips down some soda and throws the cup in the garbage bag. The bag couldn't hold any longer and explodes trash outside of the Krusty Krab. The explosion causes a fountain of trash to cover up all of Bikini Bottom, making it completely filthy. Suddenly, a boat pulls up to the Krusty Krab. The drivers come out and appear to be trash inspectors. They enter the door and look around. One takes off his sunglass and sighs.]
Trash Inspector #1: [speaking through walkie-talkie] Come in, base. We found the trash flingers.
[The purple trash inspector grabs a mop and pokes Squidward.]
Squidward: Ow. Ugh? Ugh. Ow.
Trash Inspector #2: [picks up a blob of trash with a stick] Mm-hmm. [sniffs the trash and tastes it] Just as I thought. Trying to save money on trash bags.
Mr. Krabs: I don't know what you're talking about, sir.
Trash Inspector #1: You call us Trash Inspector, not sir! We didn't go to garbage school for nothing!
Trash Inspectors: [show off their rings] Go Fighting Filthies!
Mr. Krabs: Whatever you sir, inspector.
Trash Inspector #2: What I say is... [puts on a soda can shaped judge wig] You have been found guilty of willful cheapskatery and flagrant trash flinging.
Trash Inspector #1: Your sentence is to collect all the garbage in Bikini Bottom using that. [points to a baby] Uh...that one. [points to a garbage truck]
Mr. Krabs: Whatever you say, inspectorers.
[One of the inspector's walkie-talkies buzzes.]
Radio Dispatcher: [through walkie-talkie] All units. Code 3-4-2 reported near Bikini Flats.
Trash Inspector #1: Someone's not separating their recycling. Let's ride!
[The trash inspectors hop into their boat and drive away.]
Mr. Krabs: All right, you heard the inspectors. Get to picking up that trash! [gives Squidward the empty can]
Squidward: But it was your punishment. [throws away the empty can]
Mr. Krabs: I like to think of it as our punishment. [hugs SpongeBob and Squidward] And by ours, I mean yours! [lets them go] Now get going!
Squidward: [leaves the restaurant with SpongeBob] I'm gonna do what you said, but you should know I resent it!
Mr. Krabs: I'm cool with that.
[SpongeBob and Squidward climb onto the garbage truck and begin driving to town. While Squidward is driving the garbage truck, wind blows into SpongeBob's face and SpongeBob laughs.]
SpongeBob: Aha! [picks up a bag, throws it in the truck, and crushes it] Uh-huh! [scoops up a blob of trash, throws it in the truck and crushes it] Hoo. Huh! [accidentally throws a kid in the truck] Yo! [grabs the kid before the truck crushes him] That was a close one. [laughs nervously and puts the kid down] See you later, little guy.
Squidward: Stupid, smelly garbage truck. [ties his nose in a knot so he won't smell the odor]
SpongeBob: [appears at the driver's window] Hey, Squidward! [Squidward shrieks and steers the truck out of control] Whee!
[Squidward continues to steer the truck until he gains full control of it.]
SpongeBob: [sighs] Oh, all this fresh air feels great in my holes. [his holes plays the last few notes of the "SpongeBob SquarePants" theme song]
[Squidward hits the break and stops the truck. SpongeBob flies into the mirror.]
Squidward: It's my turn to ride on the back!
SpongeBob: [slides off the mirror and giggles] It's all yours.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob driving the truck and Squidward rides on the back, feeling the fresh breeze around him.]
Squidward: Hey, this is kinda nice.
[Squidward continues to feel the breeze until the garbage truck begins to go out of control. The truck knocks over several garbage on the road.]
Squidward: SpongeBob, watch where you're driving!
SpongeBob: I'm not driving, Squidward! You know I don't have a license.
[The truck's out-of-control driving bounces SpongeBob up, down, left, and right since SpongeBob wasn't wearing a seatbelt. Meanwhile, Carl, the manager from "Selling Out" is at a boat sale trying to pick out a boat with some help from the con man.]
Carl: [whistles]
Con Man: You ready for a test drive?
[The garbage truck drives over the boat.]
Con Man: No problem, we'll try this one.
[The garbage truck drives over another boat.]
Con Man: Not to worry, we got plenty of—whoa!
[The garbage truck drives over all of the remaining boats. The boat stack onto each other and burn up. Squidward chokes on one of the tires and spits it out. Inside the truck, SpongeBob is sitting on the steering wheel, reading a book about responsibility. However, since he's not driving the truck, he nearly runs over Nancy Suzy Fish and Nat Peterson. He crashes into a nearby garbage can and nearly runs over Mrs. Puff. The truck stops and sends Squidward flying. His nose gets filled with air and floats Squidward down like a parachute.]
Squidward: Ah-choo! [lands in a pile of trash] Ugh!
SpongeBob: Wasn't that fun?
Squidward: No! Just get me out of this filth heap! [SpongeBob pulls him out and he's now covered in filth] Ugh, look at me, I'm a disgusting mess.
SpongeBob: [drops Squidward and pulls out a bottle of hand sanitizer from his pocket] Oh, here. Try this hand sanitizer.
Squidward: No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, don't—no, no!
[SpongeBob squirts some hand sanitizer on Squidward's head, while blowing a raspberry.]
Squidward: I wish you would—[notices how sparkly clean he is] Oh, hey, that's not too bad. [sighs happily and grabs his hat] Well, now, let's get all this nasty trash in the truck and get out of here. [grabs a can with tongs while holding his nose] Ew, ew, ew, ew. [throws the can in the truck] Ew! [SpongeBob throws a blob of trash in the truck, which splatters some goop from the inside] Oh! Watch it!
SpongeBob: Sorry, Squidward. Hm—ooh! [sees an old baby doll in the trash and picks it up with his eye]  Oh, ho! What a cute little dolly! He can be our truck mascot and ride with us in the cab.
Squidward: [takes out the tongs and picks up the doll] Oh, great idea. Why don't I put him up front while you pick up the rest of the trash?
SpongeBob: Thank you, Squidward.
[Squidward enters the truck, throws the doll near the window and lazily rests.]
Doll: I wanna have fun.
Squidward: Huh? [pokes the doll]
Doll: I wanna get good grades.
Squidward: Well, you should stop saying wanna, then.
Doll: [turns its head] I wanna destroy you.
Squidward: What the— [shrieks]
[Squidward panics inside the truck, throws the doll out and runs away. SpongeBob throws two more garbage bags in the truck and crushes them.]
Squidward: That doll's possessed!
[Squidward's outburst startles SpongeBob. SpongeBob falls into the truck and gets crushed by the masher inside. He comes out looking like the letter "U".]
SpongeBob: That was so fun! You gotta try it!
Squidward: Forget it, you nitwit! There's no way I'm getting in the back of that filth wagon! [he ironically falls in the truck and gets crushed by the masher as well] Oh, my internal organs!
[The masher crushes Squidward again. SpongeBob pulls him out as he looks like the letter "T".]
SpongeBob: [giggle] Hey, look. [sticks Squidward onto his U-shaped body] We fit! [laughs and shakes around] Isn't this cozy?
Squidward: Please let this nightmare end.
[The scene changes to SpongeBob picking up trash with the trucks mechanic arms. He picks up two blobs of trash and puts them in the truck. However, he grabs Squidward and uses him as a dust pan to brush up the remaining trash in a dust pan. The scene changes to SpongeBob throwing trash in the garbage bag. But he somehow threw trash in Squidward's face as he holds the bag.]
SpongeBob: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!
[SpongeBob and Squidward throw more trash bags in the truck. They continue to do their garbage men duty until the entire town is sparkly clean.]
SpongeBob: We did a good job. Bikini Bottom looks so clean now.
Squidward: Just one more house, and I can finally say good-bye to this trash life. Let's get these in the truck and get out of here.
[SpongeBob and Squidward pick up two garbage cans near Patrick's house and attempt to carry them to the truck. But Patrick comes out and is really angry.]
Patrick: Hey! Get away from my stuff!
SpongeBob: Oh, this isn't stuff, Patrick. It's trash, and it needs to be thrown into the trash truck.
Patrick: No, it's mine! [grabs the garbage can and growls and barks like a dog]
Squidward: [picks up a stick and throws it] Fetch!
[Patrick runs off to fetch the stick. He grabs the stick and chews on it like a dog.]
SpongeBob: Ooh, that looks fun!
Squidward: Forget about the stick, and help me get these cans in the truck.
[SpongeBob and Squidward pick up the garbage cans again and attempt to take them to the truck. Patrick notices them and spits out the stick.]
Patrick: Hm? Patooie! You betrayed me, stick!
[Patrick runs up to Squidward and tries to take the garbage can back.]
Squidward: Let go! SpongeBob, help me!
[SpongeBob throws the other can and goes to help Squidward.]
Squidward: Hold on, SpongeBob! [runs back into the truck and grabs the garbage can with the mechanical arm]
SpongeBob: Oh!
[Squidward tries with all his might to make Patrick let go of the garbage can.]
Patrick: Get your hands off my can! [rips the mechanical arm off the truck]
SpongeBob: [with sand all over his face] Wow, Patrick. You must be working out.
Patrick: Yeah, the gym membership you got me is really paying off.
Squidward: Stop consorting with the enemy!
SpongeBob: Oh, he's not an enemy, Squidward. He's my best friend. Besides you. [kisses Squidward in the nose] Muah.
Squidward: Ew.
SpongeBob: You know, maybe we should just let Patrick keep his garbage.
Squidward: No! The trash inspector said we had to collect all the town's trash and that is what we are going to do!
Patrick: [appears in his garbage can-like battle suit] Nobody touches my trash!
Squidward: So, that's how you wanna play it. [grabs SpongeBob and drags him to the truck] It's time to take Patrick to the dump. [throws SpongeBob in the truck and climbs in]
SpongeBob: Ooh, Squidward, you sound so tough.
Squidward: Engaging battle mode! [pushes the battle mode button] Hah!
[The truck comes to life and forms into a giant, fighting robot that is similar to the robots from the "Transformers" franchise.]
Patrick: Uh-oh.
[The robot lands on the ground in battle mode.]
Squidward: This is your last chance! Give us your garbage, or you're the one who'll be trashed!
Patrick: Hah, o-oh yeah, well, you're just—uh—fight!
[Patrick, Squidward, and SpongeBob begin their battle. SpongeBob and Squidward start off with a single punch, which splatters trash on Patrick's house. Patrick punches them back and splatters trash onto Squidward's house. Patrick grabs them and spins them around while splattering trash all over the place. Meanwhile, at the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs lazily sips down a soda.]
Mr. Krabs: Ah. [throws away the cup] Picking up trash sure is hard work. [cackles just as a shadow looms over him] Uh-oh. [gets himself covered in trash and the Krusty Krab is filthy again]
[SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick continue their battle.]
Squidward: Just give me your trash!
Patrick: No! It's mine, and I love it!
Squidward: Give it!
Patrick: Never!
[Squidward fires a blob of trash from the robot's hand. But Patrick uses the garbage can lid to deflect the attack. Moments later, Mr. Krabs arrives at the scene of the commotion.]
Mr. Krabs: Knock it off! You ignoramuses are ruining all me hard work!
SpongeBob, Squidward, and Patrick: What?!
Squidward: Your hard work?! I've been tentacle deeped in trash all day and it's your fault!
[Squidward turns the robot around and drops a blob of trash onto Mr. Krabs. Mr. Krabs pops out from the goop and spits out some trash.]
SpongeBob: Trash fight!
[SpongeBob and Squidward throws a blob of trash at Mr. Krabs. But Mr. Krabs ducks and it lands in Patrick's mouth. Patrick eats the trash and gets splattered.]
Patrick: Hey!
[SpongeBob, Patrick, Squidward and Mr. Krabs throw a massive amount of garbage at each other. Their fight causes Bikini Bottom to become filthy and dirty again. Suddenly, the trash inspectors arrive and they're not very happy.]
SpongeBob, Squidward, Mr. Krabs and Patrick: Uh-oh.
[One of the trash inspectors crushes his sunglasses. The scene changes to SpongeBob, Mr. Krabs, and Squidward doing community service by cleaning up the mess they made from their fight. Although, Patrick was not seen helping them with their punishment. Just then, a boat pulls over and the doll throws an empty soda cup onto Squidward's head.]
Doll: Wanna pick that up? [giggles as the doll drives away and SpongeBob waves good-bye]
Squidward: I hate that doll.
