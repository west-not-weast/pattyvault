Squidward: Ah, how I have dreamed of this day. Mr. Tentacles, Professor of Art. What a marvelous opportunity for the people of Bikini Bottom. Bring me your huddle masses of bored house wives and I will shape them into my image. [wife's head turns into Squidward's and the husband notices] And I'll go down in history, someday. And there will be a wing with my name on it in all the museums of the world!
Janitor: Dude, you're teaching art at the Rec Center. Calm down.
Squidward: Uncultured trash urchin. 9am. Time to let the class in. Well, don't want to keep them waiting any longer. [opens door] Welcome to art class!
