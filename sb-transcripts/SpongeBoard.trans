[everyone is enjoying their day at the Goo Lagoon, SpongeBob and Patrick both see a surfer riding a wave]
SpongeBob: See, Patrick? Now that is surfing!
Patrick: I wanna try! I wanna try!
SpongeBob: Let's do it! [lies on his back on the water] Your surfboard awaits.
Patrick: Oooooohhh.
[Patrick is on SpongeBob, he sees a wave and surfs on it, and laughs]
SpongeBob: This is awesome! [but because he's a sponge, he starts absorbing water, and grows bigger]
Patrick: I feel so floaty! Hey, why aren't we, huh? [SpongeBob is now at gigantic size, with all of the water absorbed]
Surfer: Uh, excuse me. Can we have our ocean back?
