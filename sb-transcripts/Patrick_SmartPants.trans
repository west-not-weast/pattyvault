[SpongeBob & Patrick are running through Jellyfish Fields laughing trying to capture jellyfish]
Patrick: [pokes SpongeBob] You're it! [both laugh]
SpongeBob: [pokes Patrick] You're it! [both laugh. Patrick runs off] Wait, Pat, you're it! [notices a sign a few yards away and yelps. Patrick laughs, not paying attention] The sign!
Patrick: Huh? [tries to read it as he is running] Duuhh... aaann... ger... [crashes through the sign and falls off the cliff] cliff!
SpongeBob: Patrick! [runs down the cliff to Patrick] Let me help you out of there, buddy! [grabs a starfish shaped head out of the ground. When he notices it's just a head, he screams] Is the rest of you down there?
Patrick: [walks up to SpongeBob with no head attached to his body] The rest of me is up here.
SpongeBob: Whew, you had me worried there, buddy. [laughs] Here's your head. [attaches the head onto Patrick and laughs. Picture of inside Patrick's head shows a plug plugging into an outlet. Gears and cranks start up. Patrick gets a spark or two from his head]
Patrick: I find all this laughter to be highly illogical.
SpongeBob: Well, let's stop laughin' and let's start fishin'! [takes out two jellyfish nets. Hands a net to Patrick] Go ahead, you get first crack.
Patrick: [jellyfish floats by] Look at them. These graceful stoic creatures of the deep.
SpongeBob: Huh? Those are some big words, Pat. I've never heard you use them before.
Patrick: Nonsense, my vocabulary is infinitely expanding.
SpongeBob: Well, let's expand our jellyfish nets! C'mon, Patrick! [captures a jellyfish] Look, buddy, I captured one!
Patrick: Yes... [shows SpongeBob a notebook with a Davinci-style jellyfish drawn] I captured one as well without disturbing its delicate ecosystem. It is wrong to harness nature in such a barbaric manner. [frees the jellyfish from SpongeBob's net]
SpongeBob: Okay...what do you wanna do?
Patrick: Let us go off and admire the beauty and fragility of nature.
SpongeBob: Pretty.
Patrick: Yes, quite.
SpongeBob: Fragile.
Patrick: Indeed.
SpongeBob: [jumps at Patrick three times] C'mon, Patrick, let's do something fun!
Patrick: Oh, you want to run some statistics or observe phenomenon and render hypothesis of said phenomenon?
SpongeBob: I was thinking more like jumping rope, [jumps rope with his arms] 1-legged races [one leg goes inside his body and he hops on his remaining leg], or playing duck-duck-hermit crab. [jumps into a hermit-crab shell and blows bubbles]
Patrick: Doesn't feel like fun.
SpongeBob: [pops out of the shell] How about some jokes? [Patrick sighs] Patrick, what's the difference between a guitar and a jellyfish?
