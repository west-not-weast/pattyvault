Narrator: Ask Patrick Anything!
[Patrick's rock appears and Patrick comes out]
Narrator: You can ask this sincere sea star and his magic rock anything, and he'll certainly have an answer for you.
Patrick: Yes sir! Just like a genie!
Narrator: Let's try together. Patrick, is tomorrow going to be a good day?
[the rock closes and shakes]
[Patrick comes out again]
Patrick: [says yes repeatedly]
Narrator: Told ya. He knows everything.
Narrator: Now you think of a question. That's right. You. Any question, got it? Ask now!
[the rock closes and shakes]
[Patrick comes out again]
Patrick: My head is saying yes, but my tummy is saying no. And I always trust my tummy, so, no.
Narrator: There's your answer. But before another question, ask Pat!
[the rock closes and shakes]
[Patrick comes out again]
Patrick: You'll find the answer in your heart. Or, is it butt?
Narrator: Hmm, probably not the answer you expected. Now viewer, think of a really big question. Ready, Set, Ask!
[The rock closes and shakes]
Narrator: What say you now, all seeing Patrick?
[Patrick comes out again]
Patrick: I have one answer, and one answer only. [whispering] Applesauce.
Narrator: Umm, Patrick, wanna try that again?
Patrick: Ask later. I'm busy.
Narrator: Umm, that was... Ask Patrick Anything!
Patrick: The inner machinations of my mind are an enigma.
Narrator: They certainly are, Patrick. They certainly are.
