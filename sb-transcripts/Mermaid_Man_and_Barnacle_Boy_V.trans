Narrator: The New Adventures of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy. [we see a long line to the Krusty Krab] In a familiar restaurant, in a familiar part of town, a call goes out in frustration.
Frank: Will you hurry up?
Narrator: A call that would normally be answered by Bikini Bottom's semi-retired champions. If they weren't the ones causing the problem.
Mermaid Man: Let's see... I want a... no. [Shows a brief shot of Krusty Krab Menu] I want a... [camera returns to Mermaid Man] uh, no, uh, hmmm...
Squidward: Sir, will you please order already? You're holding up the line!
SpongeBob: [whispering in Mermaid Man's ear] Psst. Hey, Mermaid Man, get a Krabby Patty.
Mermaid Man: I've made my decision!
Line of Customers: Hooray!
Mermaid Man: One Krabby Patty for me and a Pipsqueak Patty for the boy.
Barnacle Boy: Now, wait just a darn minute!
Line of Customers: Awww!
Barnacle Boy: I don't want a Pipsqueak Patty! I want an adult size Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: The Krabby Patty is too big for you. You'll never finish it.
Barnacle Boy: Don't you see what you're doing? You're treating me like a child!
Mr. Krabs: The boyâ€™s eyes are bigger than his stomach. [laughs]
Barnacle Boy: And that's another thing, I'm not a boy! I'm so old I got hairs growing out of the wrinkles in my liver spots. [shows a hair popping out]
Squidward: [snickering] One Pipsqueak patty [close up of the patty] and your bib and highchair.
Barnacle Boy: I'm 68 years old and I want a Krabby Patty!
Mermaid Man: Your Pipsqueak is getting cold. Shall I feed you?
Barnacle Boy: Feed this, old man! [slaps the Krabby Patty out of Mermaid Man's hand]
All except MM and BB:  Ooooooooh.
Barnacle Boy: I'm tired of playing second banana to a man who wears a bra! From now on, I want to be called Barnacle Man! And, I'm through protecting citizens that don't respect me!
SpongeBob: I respect you, Barnacle Man!
