196a
[The episode begins with Sandy having a relaxing day at her treedome. When suddenly she hears a honking noise.]
Sandy: Huh?
[A package from above falls in front of her door.]
Sandy: [gasps] It's here! Yee-haw! My newest science book has arrived! I wonder what new and fantastic area of science will be revealed to me this month! [Another rock bangs her head revealing bloomers in a balloon.] Oh, hey! It's those fancy bloomers I ordered too! This day just keeps getting better! [She walks into treedome, sits at picnic table, opens box and reads her new book.] Ahh! Behavorial psychology is the study of people and their habits. I studied underwater chemistry, geology, and astronomy, but I never studied underwater people!
[The scene changes to Sandy riding on a bus. She turns on her recording device and begins analyzing.]
Sandy: Sandy Cheeks. Day one of behavioral study of subjects in Bikini Bottom. Initiating observations, [checks her watch] now!
[Sandy begins her observations as she looks carefully at the fish riding in the bus.]
Charlie: My mom says she wouldn't even try it. No matter how much I saw the lagoons.
Amanda's mother: My daughter Amanda is exactly the same. It's always an argument, but I've tried to...
[Sandy interrupts the conversation by sliding in between Fred and Charlie and begins observing.]
Sandy: Older lumpy looking female subject. Obviously, a mother. Hates daughter.
Amanda's mother: Excuse me?
Sandy: Subject asked to be excused, but I am unable to observe what she wishes to be excused from.
Fred: Hey! Creepy squirrel! What's with all the eavesdropping?
Charlie: Take a hike, mammal!
Sandy: Emotional state seems to be rising in anger. Eyebrows are now considerably furrowed.
[As she is observing, Charlie and Fred push Sandy off the seat and the driver kicks her out of the bus. Sandy lands on the ground and straightens herself out.]
Sandy: I gotta find new subjects.
[The driver throws her recorder and microphone at her head.]
Sandy: Who won't mind being observed.
[Sandy sees SpongeBob and Patrick running around playing.]
Sandy: Eureka!
Prospector: Hey, that's my line!
[Sandy walks up to SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hey, fellas! How'd you like to be part of my cool experiment?
[Patrick breathes green air out of his mouth and his face is charred.]
Patrick: Ooh! I could use a mint! Mmm!
Sandy: No, Patrick. It's an experiment in behavioral psychology.
Patrick: That doesn't sound tasty.
SpongeBob: What do we have to do?
Sandy: It's easy. I observe you while you two act normal.
SpongeBob: Act normal?
Sandy: Yeah. Just do what you naturally do. [holds out recorder and microphone] Be natural. Starting... now!
[SpongeBob and Patrick stand straight like robots.]
SpongeBob: Uh, natural greeting to you, friend.
Patrick: Natural greeting returned.
[Sandy didn't find that impressive so she did some hand gestures to make SpongeBob and Patrick do something else.]
SpongeBob: Would you like to have some natural fun?
Patrick: Oh, yes. Please.
SpongeBob: Naturally. [laughs nervously and sweats]
Sandy: Aww. Alright. Experiment's done.
[SpongeBob and Patrick move back to their positioned places.]
SpongeBob: Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! What are the results?
Patrick: [laughs] Hey, did we do good?
SpongeBob: Oh, can I have an "A" plus?
Patrick: Oh! Oh! Yeah! [squishes SpongeBob] I want an "A" plus too!
[SpongeBob giggles with excitement.]
Patrick: Pretty please? Pretty please? Pretty please?
SpongeBob: [makes cute face] Pretty please with sugar on top?
Sandy: Yes, yes. You both get an "A" plus.
SpongeBob: Whoo!
Patrick: I knew it!
[SpongeBob and Patrick hive-five each other.]
Sandy: Subjects acting natural. Resume observation.
SpongeBob: We got an "A" plus!
[Sandy holds out her microphone and SpongeBob and Patrick stopped moving around and went back to standing up straight like robot as they did before. She pulls the microphone back and they both start moving again.]
SpongeBob and Patrick: "A" plus! "A" plus! "A" plus!
Sandy: Oh, forget it.
[The scene changes to Sandy looking at her book while SpongeBob and Patrick dance around inside SpongeBob's house.]
Sandy: When a subject is aware of being observed, it can affect his or her actions and create inaccurate data. Hmm...
[Sandy looks at SpongeBob and Patrick laughing through the window. They both slip inside the house quietly.]
Sandy: Double eureka!
Two Prospectors: That's our line!
[The scene changes to the Sandy inside the house with SpongeBob and Patrick.]
Sandy: Hey! Are you guys up for another experiment?
SpongeBob: Oh boy! Am I ever! Can you hook us up to electrodes? Or, or expose us to gamma rays?
Patrick: Yeah?
Sandy: It's a guaranteed "A" plus.
Patrick: Oh! It's like a dream!
Sandy: Okay. First thing. Go to the beach and fill one bucket with white sand and one bucket with black sand. Can you do that?
SpongeBob: Easy sneezy!
[Patrick sneezes on SpongeBob. SpongeBob is covered in saliva and Patrick's brain is sticking out of Patrick's nostril. Patrick sniffs his brain back into his head.]
Sandy: [grossed out] Ew.
Patrick: Hey, yeah. Whatever he said.
Sandy: Then off you go.
[Sandy opens the door and SpongeBob and Patrick leaves the house.]
Sandy: Time to get to work.
[Sandy begins her working process by placing cameras in many parts of SpongeBob's house and hanging microphones on the ceiling. She puts a pair of headsets on Gary.]
Gary: Meow.
SpongeBob: [offscreen] Sandy!
[Sandy pushes Gary out of sight. SpongeBob and Patrick arrive with two buckets of white and black sand.]
SpongeBob: We're back!
Sandy: Good job, fellers!
Patrick: We're an awesome team!
SpongeBob: We sure are, buddy!
Sandy: Okay, team. For this experiment, I need you to count the grains of sand in each bucket. Then tell me if there are more black grains or more white grains. Or is it the same amount? Alright then. I have to run some errands, but I'll be back later. [walks out]
SpongeBob: [laughs] Aye-aye, Captain Sandy.
Sandy: Oh. And Patrick, you're in charge.
[Patrick's brain flips and Patrick is speechless. Sandy leaves the house. Outside, an ice cream truck called Pavlovi's Ice Cream was sitting near the house. Inside the truck, Sandy is secretly beginning her experiment with a computer system installed in the truck.]
Sandy: [snickers] All systems check.
SpongeBob: Well, let's get counting. Should we both count white sand and move onto the black sand or do you want to have your own bucket?
[While SpongeBob is talking, Patrick begins to think about what Sandy said before she left.]
Patrick: [thinking] I'm in charge. I'm in charge. I'm in charge.
SpongeBob: So, what's it gonna be boss?
Patrick: Uh, the first one?
SpongeBob: [laughs] You're in charge.
