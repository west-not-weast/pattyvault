Narrator: What if SpongeBob was gone?
[Sandy and a big fish are in karate gloves]
Sandy: OK. So are we ready a little karate? Huh, big guy? Can you handle this? Do you think you're ready to witness these skills, [crushes acorns] this footwork? [juggles karate gloves] Is too fast for ya? [gloves stick out of her tongue and ears] Too inventive? I just wanna warn you so far and get pretty physical. OK. Now show me your skills. Come on now, don't be shy. Let's see the old one-two!
[the big fish moves his arm and leg and loses balance]
Sandy: Dang.
[falls on Sandy]
Sandy: This is much more fun with SpongeBob.
