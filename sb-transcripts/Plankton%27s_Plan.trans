Plankton: [gets up onto soap box] I, Plankton, with my superior intellect, [points at head] devised a plan to crush the Krusty Krab once and for all! [looks around] If people won't come to the Chum Bucket, I will bring the Chum Bucket to the people! Behold! The receptacle of your doom, Mr. Krabs! [laughs evilly, then ground shakes, and Plankton is tossed to the ground by the movement] Wait, this isn't- [ground shakes again, and Plankton is thrown against what seems to be an invisible wall] Mommy!
Man: [the camera zooms out revealing that Plankton was in a glass of water the whole time.] Your water, Serena.
Serena Williams: [takes a sip of water and then spits it out] Who put sea monkeys in my drink? Ugh! [pours water into plant pot]
Plankton: Ahhhhh!
Serena: What was that? Did you hear that?
[end of short]
