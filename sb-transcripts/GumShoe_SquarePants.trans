[shows SpongeBob blowing on a pipe]
SpongeBob: The question still persists, why do they call me GumShoe? [he steps on a piece of gum and pulls it off of his boot] Well, maybe this is why! But where did it come from? [he looks through a magnifying glass and breaks it with his eye] More importantly, can I exercise the five second rule? Hmmm, why not? [starts chewing on the piece of gum and starts walking again. Suddenly, he hears a disgusting crunching sound.] What now? [He lifts up his shoe, where Plankton has been squished under his heel.]
Plankton: Hey, watch where you're going you...
SpongeBob: Plankton, huh? Wait! Now would they call me PlanktonShoe SquarePants? Well I like the ring of it. There's only one logical option. [He proceeds to wipe Plankton across the ground, making him scream. After he has smeared him off, he sticks the piece of gum back on his shoe] Well that's one mystery solved, now it's on to the next. Where am I?
