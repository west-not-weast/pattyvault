[Man Ray steals Mermaid Man's nose as he laughs evilly]
Mermaid Man: You better give that back, Man Ray!
Man Ray: [He laughs evilly again] Or what? [Man Ray bangs into Mermaid Man]
Mermaid Man: Or I'll take it back. [whistles in order to summon his nose back on his face] Now prepare for a help heaping helping of quick frying Tartar Sauce!
Man Ray: Oh no!
[the tartar sauce bin is shown empty]
Mermaid Man: Huh, empty?
Barnacle Boy: But how?
Patrick: [burps] What?
Man Ray: [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy get tied up] Well, well, well! Not so tough without your Tartar...
Mr. Krabs: Argh! [pours tartar sauce all over Man Ray, Man Ray sighs]
Mermaid Man: Who was that?
Barnacle Boy: I dunno.
Mr. Krabs: They call me "Super Tightwad!" [snaps the rope off of Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy and hands Mermaid Man a bill] Here's me bill for services and renders.
Mermaid Man: [$81,207.00 is shown on the bill] What? We don't have that kind of money.
Mr. Krabs: No money, eh?
Mermaid Man: [at the Krusty Krab] Two large Krabby Patties, comin' right up, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Doing great, boys. Just six more years to pay off your debt. [laughs]
Mermaid Man: Man Ray suddenly doesn't seem very evil.
Barnacle Boy: No.
