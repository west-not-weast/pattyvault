Nigel: It all started with the first snowfall of the year. [he slips the ice and falls down to the ground] Yah.
Carl: It's perfect!
Sheen Estevez: It's awesome!
Cindy Vortex: It's hideous.
Jimmy: What it needs is my latest invention: I call it "The Spoofinator 4000." Now let's fire it up. [puts hat on top of the snowman and it turns it into a real Patrick Star]
Patrick: Birthday happy.
Sheen Estevez: All right, he's alive.
Nigel: The children loved their new winter friend. And it wasn't long before they were spending all their time together.
