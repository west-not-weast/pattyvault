[Everyone is sleeping until SpongeBob's foghorn alarm wakes them up]
Squidward: SpongeBob...
SpongeBob: Good morning, Squidward!
Squidward: SpongeBob, what are you doing in my house?!
SpongeBob: I came to make sure you don't oversleep and miss work.
Squidward: Oh gee, SpongeBob, that's very thoughtful of you.
SpongeBob: My pleasure, Squidward. That's what good neighbors are for.
Squidward: You did overlook one teensy little detail, however.
SpongeBob: What's that, Squidward?
Squidward: (provoked) IT'S SUNDAY! [angrily kicks SpongeBob out of his house] A good neighbor doesn't bother me on Sunday!
SpongeBob: Sunday? No wonder Squidward's grumpy. He forgets his Sunday papers. This'll show Squidward I'm a good neighbor. I'll bring it to him. [breaks the string that holds the paper together] Man this is heavy. [bumps into Patrick] Oh, pardon me.
Patrick: Hey, watch where you're going. [screams] Newspaper monster!
SpongeBob: [throws paper in the air, screaming] Monster! [both scream and run around]
Squidward: Will you two nincompoops kindly quiet down?! I am not going to let them ruin the rest of my Sunday. [hums] My Sunday relaxation kit. [reaches into box] Let's see…pillow. [puts pillow on end of couch] Placed ever so for slight foot elevation. Flower--to brighten the room. Flower fragrance. [sprays fragrance on flower. The flower dies] Ah, and the final touch. [dials on phone] Yes, I'd like to order the Sunday special. Yes, pedicure and foot massage house call, that is correct. See you at 4 my good man. [hangs up phone] This is gonna be a heavenly day. Oh, I almost forgot. [grabs a box] Bon-bons. Hello there, heaven's little wonder. Take me on a chocolate vacation. [SpongeBob & Patrick raise up from behind the couch making noises. Squidward spits out his chocolate]
SpongeBob & Patrick: By the all seeing eye, ye are worthy. We are not.
Squidward: What are you two idiots doing?
Patrick: Secret ritual.
SpongeBob: To inaugurate you as president.
Squidward: Me? President of Bikini Bottom? I knew the people would come to their senses.
Patrick: No, silly. Not the president of Bikini Bottom. Even better.
Squidward: Better?
SpongeBob: You're the president of 'The Secret Royal Order of the Good Neighbor Lodge'.
Squidward: The what? Is this some stupid club you two made up? [SpongeBob & Patrick laugh]
Patrick: Maybe. [both laugh]
SpongeBob: It's a secret. [both laugh]
Squidward: Fine. As my first presidential decree, why don't you, uhh, go out and paint all the leaves on the trees to make the neighborhood look nicer? [pushing SpongeBob & Patrick out the door] Now out, out, out, out, out, out. That'll keep them busy for a few Sundays. [when he closes the door, SpongeBob & Patrick appear from inside]
SpongeBob: What colors should we paint the laves, your presidentialocity?
Squidward: Polka dots! Now don't bother me anymore.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Wow. Polka dots.
Patrick: Our new president is a genius.
SpongeBob: Yeah. [both laugh]
SpongeBob & Patrick: See ya later, Squidward.
SpongeBob: [now outside, a red paint can drops on the ground] Whenever you're ready, Patrick.
Patrick: [Patrick unscrews SpongeBob's hat which turns out to be a screw] Hold still, buddy. [pours the red paint inside SpongeBob's hole. When he is done, he throws the can away and ends up hitting an elderly citizen riding a bike. Patrick screws the hat back in]
SpongeBob: Okay, Pat, gimme a quick shake.
Patrick: Okie dokie. [Patrick shakes SpongeBob]
SpongeBob: Okay! I'm ready! [Patrick grabs SpongeBob's arm and uses it like a slot machine. Drops of red paint come shooting out SpongeBob's holes and onto trees] Hey, that worked perfectly. C'mon, good neighbor Patrick, let's paint the town polka dot.
Squidward: [clock on wall is ringing noon] Oh, no. It's already noon. I will be darned if I let those morons eat up anymore of my valuable Sunday.
SpongeBob & Patrick: [outside one of Squidward's windows singing] Good neighbors are we. La-la-la-la-la-la.
Squidward: What's going on out there?
SpongeBob: Hi, president Squidward. Almost done painting the- [Patrick pulls on SpongeBob's arm which makes the paint shoot out his holes and all over Squidward's face and in his eyes]
Squidward: [screams] My eyes! [runs around bumping into stuff. Runs outside and in front of a car]
Gale Rechid: Look out! [car slams on brakes and stops in front of Squidward]
Ralph: Oh, you poor man.
Gale: You must be very sick! Let us take you to the hospital.
Squidward: No really, I'm fine. Please, I…no, uhh… [car drives off]
SpongeBob & Patrick: See ya later, neighbor!
Patrick: It is a lovely day for a ride in the country.
SpongeBob: Yeah, our president sure knows how to live. [later] I'd like to call this meeting of the good neighbor lodge to order. Let's begin with role call: Patrick. [Patrick is snoring] OK…Squidward? [Squidward's chair is empty] Squidward? Squidward, you home?
Patrick: Did you find him, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Nope. I guess he's still on his Sunday drive.
Patrick: Or maybe he's on a secret mission.
SpongeBob: I hope he's not in danger.
Patrick: Danger?!
SpongeBob: As members of the good neighbor lodge, we are sworn to protect our president from danger.
Harold (red fish): Excuse me? Somebody ordered a relaxing pedicure and foot massage? The Sunday special?
SpongeBob: Brother Star, we'd better check this guy out. Make sure he's safe for Squidward.
Squidward: At least I still have my Sunday pedicure to look forward to. [SpongeBob & Patrick are laughing inside Squidward's house. Squidward opens his front door] What are you two doing in my house?
SpongeBob: We're checking to make sure this guy really is a certified foot masseur and not some kind of assassin.
Patrick: I say he checks out a-ok.
SpongeBob: Squidward, have you ever seen more lovely French tips? [shows foot with long toenails]
Squidward: French tips, huh? [pushes SpongeBob's chair to the side] Alright, pal, make with the foot massage, pronto!
Harold (red fish): Uh-oh. Sorry. Your hour's up.
Squidward: [He angrily twitches his eye. As SpongeBob continues wiggling his toes, he furious turns red and makes way toward the front door] Alright, you two! Out! [SpongeBob and Patrick walk out] And don't even think about dragging your empty skulls around here for the rest of the day. Or tomorrow, or next week.
SpongeBob: Squidward, does that include…
Squidward: [angrily screams]  'Yes, it does! [furiously slams door]
SpongeBob: Gee, Patrick, do you think Squidward was trying to tell us something?
