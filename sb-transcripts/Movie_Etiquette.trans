[The Nickelodeon logo appears in front of Bikini Atoll. The camera pans below the water, where the Reef Cinema is showing a film called "A Sea Star Is Born."]
French Narrator: Ah, ze cinema. A magical place for all to enjoy, so long as we follow a few simple rules.
Squidward: [He hums and walks into the theater. He sees an open seat.] Oh! Ah.
SpongeBob: Oh, hi, Squidward!
Squidward: Grr...
French Narrator: In case of emergency, always take a moment to locate your nearest exit...
[Patrick slams the exit door on an usher.]
French Narrator: And try to find your seat before the film begins.
Patrick: Excuse me! [He sits near Squidward.]
Squidward: Huh? [He grumbles angrily.]
French Narrator: Please do not disrupt the film for others. This means no gum chewing.
[Patrick loudly chews gum and blows a bubble in Squidward's face.]
French Narrator: No bouncing.
[SpongeBob bounces up and down on his seat, annoying Squidward.]
French Narrator: No armrest hogging.
[Patrick hogs the armrest, intruding on Squidward's space.]
French Narrator: No jellyfishing.
[A jellyfish swims by. SpongeBob catches it and Squidward in his jellyfishing net. It zaps Squidward, and he screams.]
SpongeBob: Whoops! Sorry!
French Narrator: No hamboning.
Patrick: Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh! [He slaps his knees and chest.]
French Narrator: No gargling.
SpongeBob: [He loudly gargles in front of Squidward.]
French Narrator: No play fighting.
[SpongeBob and Patrick play-fight with each other.]
Squidward: Sit down and stop ruining my night off!
[A larger, muscular usher grabs Squidward and clenches his head real tight.]
French Narrator: And of course, no talking.
[The usher takes Squidward out of the theater. SpongeBob and Patrick shrug.]
SpongeBob: Enjoy the movie, Patrick!
Patrick: Shh! No talking!
