[on the bus]
SpongeBob: I can't wait to see the ancient rains, I even brought an umbrella. [opens umbrella]
Sandy: Ancient ruins, not rains. [bus stops, everyone get out of the bus and goes to the ancient ruins, Sandy takes a photo using her camera]
SpongeBob: Gee, Sandy! I can't wait to see the inside.
Sandy: Behold! The uncharted caverns of Lemuria. Now remember, SpongeBob, this place is filled with delicate artifacts, don't touch anything.
SpongeBob: [smiles] Hey look, an ancient Lamorian toilet plunger, [SpongeBob pulls the lever] he-he sorry. [a twisted pentagon entrance appears, Sandy and SpongeBob walk inside] This place is sure a Brain Twister.
Sandy: I'm losing track of which way is up in here.
SpongeBob: Oh, I'd say up is... [points his finger behind them] Oh, that way.
Sandy: Up is that way?
SpongeBob: Yep.
Sandy: Then that means... [the screen turns sideways] Oh, boy.
SpongeBob and Sandy: Ahh...! [falling and screaming, Sandy and SpongeBob stop falling, SpongeBob is still screaming then stops slowly]
Sandy: We're ok, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Oh! Ok.
SpongeBob and Sandy: [They walk into a different room] Wow!
Sandy: Looks like some sort of control module or maybe a holographic projector. [Sandy places her hands on the activation circles] Whoops! Well, I guess we're gonna find out what this doohickey does. [machine opens]
SpongeBob: [A diamond prism comes out] Oooh, purty.
Sandy: SpongeBob, no! [The prism fires a laser] Look out! [The laser hits the top of Sandy's tail and it's hair and skin burns off]
SpongeBob: What's it doing? [The laser hits a crystal and aims at two diamonds, they soon come out the walls in tubes and make direct contact]
Sandy: This place sure got a friendlying hurry. [Three pieces of the tube spin, when it stops three holes pop out three steel balls] Duck! [SpongeBob and Sandy duck, the three balls land in three robot bodies, their faces and arms come out and go to SpongeBob and Sandy]
SpongeBob: Aw! Look, cute. [Two robots trap Sandy and SpongeBob inside magic bubbles] Kinda reminds me of bubble blowing. [The bubbles rise up, the three robots, Sandy, and SpongeBob go into a new room, the bubbles pop and Sandy and SpongeBob crash]
Sandy: Whoa, what is this place?
Robot #1: You now stand in the most sacred place in all of Lemuria.
SpongeBob: [SpongeBob walks up to a glowing sculpture] Mesmerizing.
Robot #1: I see you are an art lover, the sculpture of the Sphere Laser Dichotomy, it really holds the room together.
Sandy: I didn't realize the Lemurias were a race of robots.
Robot #1: Not originally. [Flashback] The Lemurias actually created us as a legion of janitor bots, and that's what we did until the great disaster. [Huge explosion] But, when we realized that we were the only survivors, we took it upon ourselves to maintain the technology and customs of the once great civilization. [Back to the present] That's not to say it's been easy, it's been a couple of millennia.
SpongeBob: Ooh! Really, really, mesmerizing. [SpongeBob's touch destroys the sculpture, the ruins start to fall apart]
Robot #1: You fools, what have you done? We told you, it really holds the room together.
SpongeBob: Sorry, I didn't think you meant it literally!
[The Ruins are destroyed, everyone gasp]
Narrator: Two Days Later.....
SpongeBob: [Sandy and SpongeBob survived the disaster] Gee, I feel bad for those poor robots, they worked so hard to keep this place clean.
Sandy: Speaking of which.
Robot #1: [The robots are doing a campfire] Those two idiots.
SpongeBob: Oh, please forgive me robots, I didn't mean to ruin your ruins.
Robot #1: Oh, what's the point. Our way of life has been destroyed, we no longer have a purpose.
[The robots move to a different spot]
Robot #3: Looks like a good place to just dry out in the sun. [The robots shut themselves down]
SpongeBob: Hey, hey, don't be down. I know just the thing to get you out of this funk.
[Scene cuts to the Krusty Krab, SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs walk into the restroom]
SpongeBob: How's it going, guys?
Robot #2: Wonderful.
Robot #3: Very fulfilled!
Robot #1: [uses his toilet plunger] Thank you, you have restored our dignity.
Mr. Krabs: Uh, how much are these tin cans gonna cost me?
SpongeBob: Not a penny, they're just doing what they were made to do.
Mr. Krabs: No thanks, SpongeBob, I'm already not paying you to clean the toilets.
SpongeBob: Oh, but Mr. Krabs, I did accidentally destroy their way of life.
Mr. Krabs: [Laughs] Just fooling, sonny, and besides, why would I start saying no to free labor now?
[Mr. Krabs, SpongeBob, and the three Robots laugh]
