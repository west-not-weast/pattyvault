[at the nursery where baby Krabs and baby Plankton are playing with a car track. Plankton is inside the toy boat]
Mr. Krabs: Vroom! Vroom!
Plankton: Do the 'Loop Dee Loop.' Again! Again! [Krabs sends Plankton on the car track which sends him flying] Wee! [goes into traffic] Zoom! [a steamroller is driving up]
Mr. Krabs: [gasp]
Driver: [on radio] Oh yeah, uh-huh. [Krabs lassos Plankton with a bunch of tied-up diapers and sends him back but into Krabs' mouth]
Plankton: Again! Again!
