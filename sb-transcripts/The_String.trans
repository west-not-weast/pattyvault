The_String
241b
[The episode begins at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is minding his own business, flipping Krabby Patties. He flips the patty in the air and flops it on his eyes. He flips the patty back on the grill and his eyes catch on fire.]
SpongeBob: [screams in pain] Ah! Yow! Oh, oh! Hot, hot, hot! [sprays hot mustard on his eyes, but it didn't help; it hurts his eyes even more] Hot mustard! [his eyes melt; grabs a fire extinguisher and sprays it in his face] Oh! Oh! Whoa! [his eyes pop back out]
Squidward: You mind? Can't you see I'm trying to read here?
[SpongeBob notices a loose string on Squidward's shirt. He goes to pull it, but Squidward turns his head.]
Squidward: Hm? [growls]
[SpongeBob goes back to flipping patties and Squidward turns around. SpongeBob becomes distracted by the loose string and goes to pull it again.] 
Squidward: What are you doing?!
SpongeBob: You have a loose thread.
Squidward: Hm? [sees the loose thread] So?
SpongeBob: [goes to reach the loose string, but Squidward slaps his hand away] I want to pull it.
Squidward: [sighs] If I let you pull it, will you please let me read my book in peace?!
SpongeBob: Mm-hm.
Squidward: Fine. Get it over with.
[SpongeBob giggles as his smile carves a circle around his face. His face falls off and he regenerates a new one. SpongeBob gleefully grabs the loose string and starts pulling it. As he pulls it, the string gets longer and longer. He climbs out through the window and unravels Squidward's shirt. Squidward growls in anger and the string cuts through his workstation and the cash register. SpongeBob goes to follow the loose string. Squidward looks down and sees himself naked. He grabs his boat and walks out in embarrassment. SpongeBob continues pulling the string and unravels the customers clothes, leaving them naked.]
Customer: [gasps] Nobody look down! [covers himself]
[The customers look down, see themselves naked, and scream.]
Fred: My leg of my pants!
[The customers cover themselves and run out. SpongeBob looks up and sees everyone is gone, oblivious to the fact that he's naked too. He continues to pull the loose string until a new customer comes in.]
SpongeBob: Seat yourself, sir. I'll be with you in a minute.
[The customer immediately leaves after seeing SpongeBob naked. Mr. Krabs is in his office, kissing a dollar bill.]
Mr. Krabs: [kisses dollar] Me most valuable possession, [grabs a picture of his daughter, Pearl] except, of course, [opens the backside of the picture and pulls out a $100,000,000 bill] for you, my love. [sighs]
[SpongeBob comes in the office while still pulling the string. SpongeBob then unravels the dollar bill and begins decreasing the amount of the bill.]
Mr. Krabs: [screams] Me appreciation is depreciating! [sees the string decreasing the bill to one dollar] Ah! No! No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [the president on the dollar bill runs away] One dollar?! [cries and wipes away the tears with the dollar]
Rich patron: [offscreen] I demand a refund!
Mr. Krabs: [runs out of his office] Uh, what's the problem here, sir?
Rich patron: There is a hair in my soup, and I demand a refund!
Mr. Krabs: [looks down and sees the loose string in the soup] Ooh. Uh, well, that's not just any hair, sir. It's from the elusive Peruvian jelly-lope, for flavor, and it's only an extra...[looks and sees his dollar in his back] $100 million charge? Hm?
Rich patron: That seems slightly exorbitant, but really, what's a measly $100 million to someone like me? [goes to take out a dollar from his wallet, but SpongeBob removes the string from the soup; he puts the dollar back in his wallet] Ah, just as well. I wasn't that hungry anyway.
[Mr. Krabs gasps in shock and explodes. He is now where tattered clothes and is completely poor. Mr. Krabs turns and leaves in depression. Meanwhile, SpongeBob comes out through the restaurant's front door and continues unraveling the loose string. He unravels the Krusty Krab sign and pulls the letters down. The letters that drop down spell "Rusty Kab". Just then, a taxi driver pulls up.]
Taxi driver: Someone order a rusty cab?
SpongeBob: I like string.
Taxi driver: Congratulations. [drives away]
[SpongeBob continues pulling the string and unravels the taxi driver's cab. The driver crashes into a building. SpongeBob continues following and pulling the loose string, stepping on the driver's face. Meanwhile, Squidward just bought himself a new shirt at the Shirts Is Us store.]
Squidward: [comes out with a new purple shirt] Ah, there's nothing quite like a brand-new shirt. Whoops. Forgot the tag.
SpongeBob: [continues pulling the loose string] I got it! [unravels Squidward's bag and new shirt, leaving him naked again]
[SpongeBob continues following the loose string and Squidward growls. The string leads SpongeBob to Sandy's treedome, where SpongeBob pulls Sandy against the glass and unravels her tail.]
Sandy: [sees her tail gone] SpongeBob!
SpongeBob: Oops. Sorry, Sandy. [pulls the string and unravels the glass of Sandy's dome]
[Sandy begins swimming up to the surface for air. Meanwhile, Squidward bought himself a sweater at the Sweat-rs store.]
Squidward: [comes out with a purple sweater] Ah, nothing beats cashmere. [starts sweating] Oh, a bit warm for a sweater today, though.
SpongeBob: [continues pulling the loose string] I can help!
Squidward: No, no, no, no! No, no, noâ€”[gets spun around by SpongeBob as he unravels his sweater; he looks down and sees himself naked again] Oh, come on!
[The scene changes to the Bikini Bottom Zoo. Bubble Bass is teasing a pack of sea monkeys with a Krabby Patty. Bubble Bass eats the patty and the monkey moans. SpongeBob comes by while pulling the loose string and unravels the cage bars, setting the monkeys free. The monkeys growl, pounce on Bubble Bass and start attacking him. Meanwhile, Squidward bought himself a suit of armor at the Swords & Such store.]
Squidward: [comes out in a suit of armor, singsongs a fanfare and opens his helmet] Let's see that twine-twirling twit try to unravel this! Huh. Huh? [his suit ironically gets unraveled by SpongeBob, leaving him naked again] Really? [his helmet closes on his nose] Ouch!
[The scene changes to dusk over the outskirts of Bikini Bottom. SpongeBob continues pulling the loose string and completely unravels all of Bikini Bottom, leaving nothing there. SpongeBob pulls the string and gets pulled up to the surface where a fisherman fished him out. SpongeBob pulls the loose string and completely unravels the fisherman until he's gone. The string leads him over to Bikini Atoll and SpongeBob unravels the island until it's gone. He pulls himself up into the sky and into outer space, where he completely unravels the Milky Way and the entire universe, leaving nothing more than a white dimension. Now, with everything completely gone, SpongeBob finally finds the end of the loose string. Just then, Patrick comes in.]
SpongeBob: Patrick, hi.
Patrick: [sees a loose string on SpongeBob's shirt] You have a thing on your thing.
[Patrick pulls the loose string on SpongeBob and unravels him into a string. Then he uses the string to floss his teeth like dental floss. SpongeBob giggles in the background, ending the episode.]
