[episode starts at the Krusty Krab. SpongeBob is in Mr. Krabs' office, and all the lights are off]
SpongeBob: You wanted to see me, sir?
Mr. Krabs: Pull up a seat, boy. [SpongeBob looks around]
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs, there aren't any chairs.
Mr. Krabs: Sit down! [SpongeBob sits on the floor] Now you've worked here for quite some time, boy.
SpongeBob: Ooh, yes, sir. And they've been the best years of my life, sir.
Mr. Krabs: That sad fact aside, midway through today's lunch rush, we ran out of, the secret ingredient [Mr. Krabs hold up a bottle] to the secret formuler! [Mr. Krabs holds up the formula]
SpongeBob: [gasps] No!
Mr. Krabs: Listen up, boy, any minute now, a truck driver is going to arrive, and iIm entrusting you to retrieve the secret ingredient! And I need you to do this with out any foulups! Understand?
SpongeBob: Could you repeat that? [Mr. Krabs looks at his watch]
Mr. Krabs: It's time! [Mr. Krabs presses a button, which makes a siren go off, and locks down the whole restaurant. A truck then arrives with S.W.A.T. team members to make a path from the restaurant to the truck] Now go! And make sure to guard it with your life!
SpongeBob: I won't let you down.
Mr. Krabs: Wait!
SpongeBob: Yes?
Mr. Krabs: If something happens to that secret ingredient, don't bother coming back to work! [SpongeBob gets scared, then walks outside, and up to the truck]
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1: You BobPants?
SpongeBob: Uh, SpongeBob.
S.W.A.T. Team Member 1: Close enough. [hands SpongeBob the case with the ingredient inside] Now get out of here, kid! Plenty of folks would love to get a hold of that ingredient.
SpongeBob: Yes, sir! [runs back to the Krusty Krab] And now, let's get you into the Krabby Patties, secret ingredienty. [notices that the secret ingredient is not there, and gasps] Where is it? Where is it? Where is it?! No! What's going to happen to the Krabby Patty secret recipe? [notices a hole] What's this? A hole? How did that happen? An incision. Almost as if someone, or something did this on purpose. That's it! A thief must have cut a hole, and swiped the secret ingredient! But who?
Mr. Krabs: SpongeBob! [he hides the case behind his back] What are you doing lolly gagging about?! Get back to work!
SpongeBob: [laughs] Right away, sir.
Mr. Krabs: Hop to it! There's a lot of hungry customers out there!
SpongeBob: Mr. Krabs trusted me, and I let him down!
Patrick: [suddenly appears] Hi SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hi, Patrick. Maybe you can help me.
Patrick: With what?
SpongeBob: With this. [shows him the case. Patrick puts some mustard on it, then puts it on buns]
Patrick: Here you go, buddy.
SpongeBob: Not that kind of help! This used to have the Krabby Patty secret ingredient inside. But now, it's missing!
Patrick: What?!
SpongeBob: Someone stole it, Patrick! And we need to find out who!
Patrick: Find out!
SpongeBob: You and I are going to need to do a little detective work! [cuts to the Chum Bucket]
Plankton: What are we eating this time, Karen?
Karen: [puts a Krabby Patty on the plate] Something new.
Plankton: Oh, you mean the "secret recipe" I came up with?
SpongeBob: Aha! I knew it was you!
Plankton: What was me?
SpongeBob: Oh, come on, Plankton, don't play dumb. You know you stole the secret Krabby Patty ingredient!
Plankton: Is this a joke?
SpongeBob: Why don't you tell me. Is it?!
Plankton: Uh, no.
