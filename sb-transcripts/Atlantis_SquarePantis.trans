[We see a live traffic jam on a busy expressway. Patchy is in one of the cars in it. He is also wearing sunglasses]
Patchy: Let's go! [honks his horn] Hey, kids. Rush hour traffic here in Encino is really bad. A little music should soothe me jangled nerves. At least my in-dash hi-fi still works. [Patchy puts a cassette tape in the radio, which breaks and the music stops. Patchy shows the broken cassette tape.] Oh! Me ultra-rare Frampton Comes Alive 8-track destroyed! [Tosses it into the car] And I'm gonna miss the new SpongeBob cartoon if this traffic doesn't move soon! [Patchy groans and moans. Patchy's cell phone rings. The ringtone is SpongeBob's piccolo from the theme song. Patchy answers the phone] Who's calling? Yes, Patchy here. Start squawking.
Potty: [squawks] Hey, Patchy, the new SpongeBob cartoon is about to start. Where are you, brawk?
Patchy: Stuck on the 101. Be a dear and record it for me, will you?
Potty: Oh, I threw out that old Betamax machine in the garbage. [squawks]
Patchy: You whaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!
Potty: Oh, calm down, beardy.
Patchy: Potty, you know how important this cartoon is to me! [Someone honks his horn at Patchy] Do you mind? I'm trying to talk to my parrot! [to Potty] Sorry, Potty. Just some land lubber. [Potty hangs up] Potty?  Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Guah. Dropped again. [Patchy closes his phone] Curse this traffic! [the traffic starts moving again] Oooooh! [Patchy pulls up his anchor. Patchy drives into a desert-like area] Arrrrrrr, home at last. What the...? [his eyes pop out from behind his pair of sunglasses, breaking them] Encino... it's gone. No! [Patchy cries] You know, kids, this kinda reminds Patchy of an old story. Another story of a lost city. Why don't you check it out? Oh, Encino. [starts crying again, episode starts. SpongeBob and Patrick are blowing bubbles]
Patrick: A beautiful specimen, SpongeBob.
SpongeBob: Hurry, Patrick, hurry! [Patrick takes a photo of the bubble and it pops] How's it look, buddy? Ready for the old scrapbook?
Patrick: More like the scrap-heap. [throws the photo into a big pile] They never come out right! Oh well, let's try again.
SpongeBob: Okay, Patrick, this one's gonna be a masterpiece.
Patrick: I'm ready. [SpongeBob blows a bubble in his image]
SpongeBob Bubble: Hi, Patrick!
Patrick: [takes a photo of the bubble but when he does, it pops] Oh, I missed it again! This darn camera isn't fast enough. [stomps on the camera]
SpongeBob: Hold on a second, Patrick! It's not the poor camera's fault you can't get a photo.
Patrick: It's not?
SpongeBob: No, it is the very nature of the fragile bubble.
Patrick: It Is?
SpongeBob: Yes, it is, my friend. Allow me to demonstrate. [blows a bubble in the shape of a microphone and starts singing] ♪The sun must set at the end of every day.♪ [the sun sets and pops] ♪And the curtain must fall at the end of every play.♪ [a curtain made of bubble soap drops down behind Patrick and pops. SpongeBob floats up on a bubble. He is surrounded by lots of other bubbles] ♪And every little bubble ever blown must someday pop.♪ [all of the bubbles pop. SpongeBob falls]
Patrick: ♪Like presents on Christmas Day, it doesn't seem to stay. Or a cheese soufflé, it doesn't last all day.♪
SpongeBob: ♪I will try again...♪
Backup Singers: ♪Try again...♪
SpongeBob: ♪...To blow a bubble...♪
Backup Singers: ♪To blow a bubble...♪
SpongeBob: ♪...That will last all day.♪
Backup Singers: ♪To blow a bubble that will last...♪
Patrick: ♪...All day.♪ [SpongeBob begins to blow a giant bubble. The bubble captures them both and floats away] Um, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Not now, Patrick. This bubble's gonna break all records!
Patrick: I hope it doesn't break until we get a little closer to the ground.
SpongeBob: Huh? [gasps] What have I done!? [The two start crying for help as the bubble drifts into a cave] We're never gonna get out of here!
Patrick: No! [the bubble is popped by a jagged point of half a broken amulet] What happened?
SpongeBob: [pointing to broken amulet] That's what happened, Patrick.
Patrick: Whoa, what is it? It looks really old.
SpongeBob; Antis, what do think that means, Patrick?
Patrick: Antis, Antis...SquarePantis! Probably belonged to your ancient ancestors. [Picks up the half of the amulet] SpongeBob SquarePantis, you must wear the ancient crest of your ancestors for it is your birthright! [shoves it into SpongeBob's face]
SpongeBob: [Falling] My birthright?! Ow, ooh, ow, ooh, ow! Let's take this to the Bikini Bottom museum, they'll know what it is!
[cut to museum]
Mr. Krabs: [Whistles] Oo...uh...beautiful day for standing outside a museum doin' nothin'.
Security Guard: Whatever you say.
Mr. Krabs: [Mr. Krabs pretends to be administration] Hello there. Welcome to the museum! That'll be three dollars.
Old Lady: But I thought it was free Tuesday.
Mr. Krabs: No, no, no. Today's Monday. Otherwise I wouldn't be wearing this "I hate Mondays" shirt.
Old Lady: Good joint.
Mr. Krabs: Enjoy the artifacts! [Mutters under breath] Don't stand in one place too long, people might mistake you for one. [Hears SpongeBob laughing] SpongeBob! [hides, then re-emerges when SpongeBob and Patrick go into the museum] Hew, that was a close one. [Old lady points him out to a police officer then Mr. Krabs runs inside]
Squidward: Neptune's ascension. The only surviving painting from the great lost city of Atlantis. This is just what the doctor ordered, Squiddy. Spending your day studying the Atlantean masters. And best of all, no Sponge... [SpongeBob and Patrick run in excitedly, knocking Squidward over] Oh, would you two watch were you're [Gasps] What is that? What are you doing with the amulet of Atlantis?
SpongeBob: We were just...
Squidward: You're going to steal it!?
SpongeBob: No. Squidward, we'd never...
Squidward: This is a new low, even for YOU TWO. Lucky for you, I was here today. Stealing artifacts could land you in the stony loneso... [Sees the amulet's half was still there and is dumbfounded]...ooooome?! You boobs found the missing half to the Atlantean amulet?
SpongeBob: What's an Atlantean omelet?
Squidward: Amulet, not omelet! It's the key to untold riches!
[Mr. Krabs shoves SpongeBob and Patrick over violently and faces Squidward]
Mr. Krabs: Did somebody say untold riches!?
Squidward: Yes Eugene. The streets are lined with gold, and the street lamps are made with diamonds.
Mr. Krabs: Diamond light bulbs! I wonder what they make the money out of.
Squidward: For reasons unknown, this great city disappeared one day, but no ruins were ever found. All the inventions that you take for granted, were given to us by the Atlanteans. Their advances in art, financial wealth and weaponry were eons ahead of their time!
SpongeBob: Why is this bubble painted on the mural?
Squidward: That's just the oldest living bubble.
SpongeBob: The oldest living bubble, alive! [shoves Patrick in front of it] Behold, Patrick-the oldest living bubble!
Patrick: This is the most beautiful bubble I've ever seen.
Squidward: That's just a painting, you quarter-wit! [to Krabs] Quarter-wit. Ha, it's less than half. The real bubble lives in Atlantis, some dumb old bubble pales in comparison to the arts...
Mr. Krabs: Money!
Sandy: [comes onto the screen from out of nowhere] And science, don't forget science. What's all the hubbub, boys?
Squidward: These two chowderbrains found the missing half to the amulet of Atlantis.
Sandy: The Amulet of Atlantis?! Legend says, that when the two halves are joined, the path to Atlantis is opened! What are y'all waitin' for? Let's hitch them two dogies up! Go on Squidward!
Mr. Krabs: Hurry up Squidward, that money ain't gettin' any younger. [Squidward connects the two halves and a bright light activates. Squidward is happy. Sandy is in disbelief. SpongeBob and Patrick exclaim excitedly.]
Patrick: [screams]
SpongeBob: Hoo hoo yeah, hoo hoo hoo!
[A van drops from the ceiling]
Squidward: The magical path to Atlantis is a van?
Mr. Krabs: Nice hot rod flames!
Patrick: [Coin spins and attaches itself to the van] What's it doing? [The door to the van opens. We fade to black, then to the van opening again. Sandy looks inside]
Sandy: Well, holly-wally ding-dang-doo. Would ya look at that!? Take a gander, y'all!
Squidward: Fabulous decor!
Mr. Krabs: Quite a vessel, but who's manning it?
Robot: Greetings. Welcome aboard the seaship Atlantis. This is a nonstop trip, so please take a seat, relax, and we'll be on our way.
Mr. Krabs: Bet there's some loose change in here!
SpongeBob: Ah, so this is what luxury feels like.
Squidward: Ah, what I wouldn't give for a foot-rub.
Robot: Attention passengers, regretfully we lack the fuel needed for forward motion.
All: What!?
[later, we see them all pushing the van to the gas station. Mr. Krabs takes the hose and tries to fill up the van with gas, but can't find the gas tank]
Mr. Krabs: Is this some kind of joke? Where's the gas tank?
Robot: We Atlanteans find the use of fossil fuels to be counter-intuitive, and have developed an alternative source we call song.
Mr. Krabs: Huh?
Robot: The engine of this vessel is fueled by song. The more you sing of your desires, the closer to Atlantis you will get. Let us commence singing.
Squidward: Does that make any sense?
SpongeBob: No, but I'm game for singing any day! ♪Sing? Sing a song? A song of wanting to move along!♪ [The van rises up and floats in mid-air. SpongeBob sings off-key] ♪To a land where all our dre-e.♪ [The van crashes back down]  Whoops, sorry. ♪To a land where all our dreeeeeams, can finally come true.♪ [The van rises up high. It makes a hole in the roof] ♪A bubble I long for, that so eludes me, but soon enough I will seeeeeeeeeeeeeee...♪
