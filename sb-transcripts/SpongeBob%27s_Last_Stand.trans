[Episode starts in Jellyfish Fields, with a clam on top of the sign. He then gets out a breath spray. As soon as the sun rises, he coughs, instead of crowing. We now see SpongeBob and Patrick waiting at the main entrance.]
SpongeBob: [looking at watch] Just two more minutes, Patrick.
Patrick: [looking at watch, although he doesn't have one] Yup!
SpongeBob: Look! Here he comes! [The jellyfishing ranger passes them]
Patrick: Who?
[The jellyfishing ranger man switches the "closed" sign to "open." He looks at SpongeBob and Patrick]
SpongeBob: Thank you, Mr. Ranger.
Patrick: Yeah, thanks. [both breathing]
Ranger: Yes?
SpongeBob: Aren't you forgetting something?
Patrick: Yeah, something.
Ranger: [grabs eyeballs and lets go of them] Please show me your-- [SpongeBob and Patrick show him their jellyfishing licenses] jellyfishing licenses.
[SpongeBob and Patrick cheer and go in, ignoring the "Open/Closed" sign they knocked over]
SpongeBob: [catches a three-spot jellyfish] Patrick, look! I caught a rare breed a glowing three-spot.
Patrick: Hey, I caught one, too! This one's a five-spot. [although it is a one-spot]
SpongeBob: [sniffles] Patrick, guess what?
Patrick: You like it here so much, you feel yourself being moved to a song?
SpongeBob: Yes, yes, how did you guess?
Patrick: Well, I kinda feel the movement coming on myself.
SpongeBob: Let's just start with the song.
Patrick: You mean "The Jellyfishing Song"?
SpongeBob: That's the one.
[both breathe in deeply, throw off their goggles and nets, and then start to sing in silly fashion]
SpongeBob & Patrick: ♪Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, it's the jellyfishing song!♪ [jellyfish claps]♪Jelly lelly lelly lelly, jelly lelly lelly jelly, everyone sing along!♪ [jellyfish claps. Patrick picks up SpongeBob, starts spinning him around, & throws him through the air; next scene shows SpongeBob and Patrick hanging onto a jellyfish's tentacles, while still singing the Jellyfishing Song'. they are singing on a desert island, surrounded by jellyfish clapping in rhythm, in calypso]♪I go jellyfishing in da' morn'in,♪
Patrick: [singing in calypso]♪I jellyfish all da' night!♪
SpongeBob: [singing in calypso]♪jellyfishing in da' afternoon,♪
SpongeBob & Patrick: [singing in calypso]♪Jellyfishing make me feel all right!♪
[next shows them running through Jellyfish Fields, singing the Jellyfishing Song]
Coral: [sings in deep opera voice]♪Everybody singgggggggg♪ [A jellyfish performs a drumroll and Patrick and SpongeBob rise out of his mouth]
SpongeBob & Patrick: ♪Everyone sing along!♪ [jellyfish beats on drum]
SpongeBob: Isn't it great that these majestic creatures have Jellyfish Fields to call their home?
Patrick: You bet! And it's highway convenient too, according to that big sign!
SpongeBob: [turns around and jumps when sees big billboard for Shelly Super Highway] Big sign? I didn't see a big- Jumping Jellyfish! That's a big sign!
Patrick: [reading board] It says, "Future site of the Shelly Super Highway."
SpongeBob: [horrified] Super highway!? Do you know what this means?!
Patrick: Well, it’s sorta like other roads, except there's no sto-
SpongeBob: I know what a superhighway is! I mean for all this jellyfish! For us! For Jellyfish Fiel-[is pulling on Patrick's skin, and accidentally rips off two pieces]-ds, uh sorry.[sticks the pieces back on]
Patrick: So what you're saying is, that if they go though with their plans, to build this new superhighway through Jellyfish Fields, that every single species of flora & fauna that makes this place their habitat will be forced out of the ecosystem that they have formed, effectively being destroyed?
SpongeBob: Well yeah, that's a simplified version, yeah, something like that, [angrily takes off goggles] which is why I hereby make this solemn vow to stop this so-called, "Shelly Super Highway," from ever being built!
[Scene now takes place in Goo Lagoon, with Larry the Lobster lifting on a barbell.]
Larry: 1,397, 1,398-- [SpongeBob appears on one of the weight plates of the barbell] Whoa!
SpongeBob: Larry, you gotta help me stop the highway!
Larry: Can't right now, bro. I got about 4,098 more reps to do. [SpongeBob slides out of the barbell, causing the other weight plate to lose Larry's balance.. Another scene takes place outside Shady Shoals, with Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy sitting on a bench]
SpongeBob: Mermaid Man! Barnacle Boy! Certainly with superpowers like yours, we can stop this superhighway! [Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy still in silence. APATHY! appears, then switches back to the scene] Hmmm.
[scene now outside Squidward's house]
Squidward: I'm sorry, SpongeBob. I actually would like to help, but I'm just too busy right now.
SpongeBob: Too busy doing what?
Squidward: I'm too busy telling you, "No!" [slams door, with SpongeBob all in pieces.. scene in the Krusty Krab. Mr. Krabs is seen cleaning the tables, while whistling. He then notices SpongeBob]
Mr. Krabs: Private SpongeBob! Ahoy!
SpongeBob: [depressed] Captain Mr. Krabs, ahoy.
Mr. Krabs: Why SpongeBob, that's not your usual four-fingered salute.
SpongeBob: I'm just upset because they're building a highway over Jellyfish Fields. [sniffles]
Mr. Krabs: Well, SpongeBob, I'd sure hate me customers to see you like this. Is there anything I can do to help?
SpongeBob: Really, Mr. Krabs?
Mr. Krabs: Sure, why not?
SpongeBob: Oh, Mr. Krabs! I just know that together, we can stop that nasty old highway from going right through Jellyfish Fields!
Mr. Krabs: [puzzled] Uh, you're not talking about the Shelly Superhighway, are ya?
SpongeBob: Yeah, why?
Mr. Krabs: Uh well, 'cause I'm actually in favor of that highway being built.
SpongeBob: [gibberish, possibly trying to say "no", while pulling on his eyeballs]
Mr. Krabs: [smiling, walks over to a poster with charts and maps on it] Yes! I've already calculated how many new customers I'll get once it's finished. You can see for yourself in this series of these charts and diagrams I have displayed!
