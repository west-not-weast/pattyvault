Announcer: In the old west, it's central to understand the basics of riding a seahorse. Are you ready, SpongeBuck?
SpongeBuck: I sure am.
Announcer: Fine. To start, [SpongeBuck is shown on the screen while the arrows are also shown], we place the right hand on the saddle horn. Then place your right foot in the stirrup located here while placing your hand there.
SpongeBuck: Okay. Right foot here. [Puts right foot on the saddle horn]
Announcer: Keeping your left leg balanced in ready here.
SpongeBuck: Left foot here. [Puts left foot on the saddle horn] Right arm there. [Puts hand on seahorse's tail]
Announcer: Well, sliding your index finger there with that left toe push up over to the upright mounting position with the foot ending on the opposite side of the back front.
SpongeBuck: Left there and [Hops on seahorse] voila!
Announcer: Well, all right. You're ready to ride.
[SpongeBuck falls down and the seahorse rides off]
