Narrator: And now, Astrology with Squidward.
Squidward: [plays clarinet] Let's look at Gemini, sign of the twins. If you're a Gemini, you've probably experienced deja vu, the feeling that this moment has happened before. And you also experience deja vu, the feeling that this moment has happened before. This month, Gemini's moon is in Uranus, so, you smell funny. My prediction for Gemini is you'll experience deja vu. [gong crashes] Meaning that this moment has happened before. I'm Squidward, your Nicktoon astrologer, reminding you not to touch my stuff.
