Pie
-1
[SpongeBob and Patrick are making a pie. SpongeBob puts some apples and a Krabby Patty in, Patrick puts some candies, toys and his pants in, Gary puts in a bone]
SpongeBob: [whistles and then puts the pie on the grill] Ah, pie fried on the grill. Just as nature intended.
Patrick: [takes the pie, forgets it's hot] Ahh! [SpongeBob takes the pie and leaves it on the window]
Squidward: [smells the pie] Mm-mm! [eats it]
SpongeBob: Squidward, have you seen our pie? The one we spent all morning cooking, just for you.
Squidward: I'm sure it'll turn up. [belches and Patrick's shorts come out in a bubble]
SpongeBob: Hey Patrick, we found your shorts!
Patrick: Hooray!
