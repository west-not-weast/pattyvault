[at Squidward's house, Squidward is humming as he is arriving at his bathroom toilet when SpongeBob, equipped with his shorts and surfboard, pops out of it, Squidward screams]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing?
Squidward: What? How'd you? Where'd you?
SpongeBob: Come on, Squidward! Since you already got a surfboard and shorts!
Squidward: [a surfboard and shorts magically appear with him, Squidward notices them] What the?
SpongeBob: And since we're already at the beach!
Squidward: [Squidward magically appears at Goo Lagoon] Wha?
SpongeBob: And the water with a huge wave behind us! [SpongeBob and Squidward are on their surfboards in the water, a huge wave goes for Squidward]
Squidward: Nooooo! [Squidward wakes up from the nightmare, he looks around to see it's not a reality, he does a sigh of relief]
SpongeBob: Hey, Squidward! Wanna go surfing? [Squidward screams, gets off his beach chair, and runs off] Hmmm. I guess surfing isn't his thing.
