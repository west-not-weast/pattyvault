SpongeBob: [walking down the street] Go, SpongeBob! Go, SpongeBob!
[an orange blimp falls from the sky, which hits and goes through the top of SpongeBob's head, and ends up on his tongue.]
SpongeBob: [picks up blimp off his tongue] What's this?
Gary: [appears in front of SpongeBob] Meow.
SpongeBob: [gasp] An orange blimp...for me?! [sets down blimp next to him, and starts cheering and dancing around] Alright! Go, SpongeBob! Yeah! Yes! [stops and looks confused, picks up the blimp,  then turns to Gary] Gary? What's a blimp?
