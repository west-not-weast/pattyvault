Johnny: And now a special message from SpongeBob SquarePants
[scene cuts to SpongeBob watering flowers]
SpongeBob: Dee, dee, doo, doo... Here is some for you. And here is a little for you. And, that should do it for today. [his eyes goes out and then it cuts to Patrick's rock where he left the garden hose on. Cuts back to SpongeBob] Patrick's wasting water! [he leaves and left the watering can rotating in the air. He then comes back and puts it down, walks down to Patrick's rock, turns the water off and knocks on it]
Patrick: [gets out] Hey, SpongeBob! What's up?
SpongeBob: Patrick, did you know you left this hose on?
Patrick: Yeah, I was leaving it on to water my plant.
SpongeBob: Well, leaving a hose running can waste [his face turns wise and the voice changes] thousands of gallons of water per month.
Patrick: Really?! [SpongeBob turns normal] Well how many gallons are we wasting when we leave a stinking shower running?
SpongeBob: Patrick!
[Patrick screams, SpongeBob jumps into Patrick's house and sucks the water up]
Patrick: Now what, SpongeBob?
SpongeBob: Now, we put this captured water to good use.
[scene cuts to Patrick watering Mrs. Puff's flowers by using SpongeBob as a watering can]
Mrs. Puff: [from the window] Thanks for watering my flowers, boys.
SpongeBob & Patrick: Sure thing, Mrs. Puff!
SpongeBob: See Patrick, saving a little water, goes a long ways.
