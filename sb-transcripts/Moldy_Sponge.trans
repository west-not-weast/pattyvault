Mr. Krabs: [holds up a green trash bag that is leaking green ooze] SpongeBob, take this bag of moldy sponges out to the garbage, will ya?
SpongeBob: Eww. [trips over a bucket] WHOA! [he flies out the door, covered in the moldy green sponges, and gasps. Then he looks up at the green moon, as a coyote howls as SpongeBob's body turns teal green] What's happening to me? [mushrooms grow out of the side of his body; his eyelashes grow extra long and he laughs evilly]
Mr. Krabs: I thought I told SpongeBob to throw these moldy sponges away. [throws SpongeBob in the dumpster and closes the lid, the lid re-opens as SpongeBob groans, annoyed]
