French Narrator: What if SpongeBob was gone?
[scene takes place at the Krusty Krab where Mr. Krabs works in the kitchen as fry cook]
Mr. Krabs: Ah, who needs him? I can manage this place and do SpongeBob's job with me eyes closed [flips a burger and puts it on a Krabby Patty] and me pockets full. [brings the Krabby Patty to Frankie] Here you are, sir. [slips on some soda on the floor] Whoa! [the Krabby Patty lands on Frankie's face] Sorry about that. [smells smoke and notices that it's from the grill] Oopsy. [blows off smoke from Patties] Phew. [but the hat lands on the grill and causes a fire to start; Mr. Krabs screams] FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! [Squidward and Frankie scream while running out of the Krusty Krab, Mr. Krabs has his head unstuck with the window and breaks the table, landing on the floor] Okay, maybe I do need SpongeBob.
