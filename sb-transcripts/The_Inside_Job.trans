[the screen displays a hamster running in the exercise wheel with carnival music playing on the screen]
Plankton: Eh, that's the life.
Karen: [screen changes to herself] PLANKTON!
Plankton: Hey, I was watching that!
Karen: And I'm tired of watching you sit around all day. Admit it, the Chum Bucket is a total failure.
Plankton: It is not! Business is just slow.
Karen: Nyah Nyah Nyah Nyah. If you'd take my advice, the Krabby Patty recipe would be yours.
Plankton: You? You're just a computer. I'm the evil genius around here.
Man: [door bangs open] This is it, son, The Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Looks like this failure has a customer. Hello. Are you lost?
Man: No, we're not lost. I promised my boy I'd take him to the Chum Bucket today.
Plankton: Really?
Man: Wow, look at that order window! It's completely covered in grime and filth.
Kid: Cool!
Man: [he smells it] Smell that air!
Kid: It makes me want to hurl!
Man: I think the Chum Bucket is the high point of our tour.
Plankton: Your tour?
Man: That's right. We're visiting the most disgusting places in bikini bottom. And so far, you're number one. Farewell, you filthy little fella. [the two leave]
Man: So What do ya say we try the city dump next?
Kid: Oh, boy!
Plankton: Groan.
Karen: So how'd it go?
Plankton: You're right. I'm such a failure.
Karen: So, do you give up?
Plankton: Yes.
Karen: You'll do what I tell you now?
Plankton: Yes.
Karen: Here's all you have to do. You want the patty recipe, then go to the man who wrote it, Eugene Krabs.
Plankton: Right. Why didn't I think of that before?
Karen: With my mind connector, you'll be able to read Krabs' mind, transferring the recipe directly into your teeny, tiny, little brain.
Plankton: Wow, that's a pretty good idea. Whoa! Um, Karen? Whoa!
Karen: Hold still.
Plankton: Mmph!
Karen: You'll need this. [puts a smaller tool with plungers attached at the end]
Plankton: And just how am I supposed to attach it to Krabs' brain?
Karen: Leave that to me, hon.
[Doors burst open]
Karen: Prepare for launch. Target in range. Launch sequence initiated.
Plankton: No! Wait!
Plankton: There he is! [launches him to Mr. Krabs, but Squidward is carrying a garbage bag] Get out of the way! This is it! [Patrick walks at outside] Move it! Ha, ha! You're mine!
[It is SpongeBob that was holding a cardboard cutout of Mr. Krabs]
SpongeBob: Hey, where do you want this life-size cutout of you, Mr. Krabs?
Plankton: No! [gets inside SpongeBob and screams]
Mr. Krabs: [offscreen] I told ya to stop playing with that thing and get back to work.
Plankton: Ugh. great.
Karen: [antenna comes out] Plankton, what happened?
Plankton: Thanks to your brilliant aim, honey, I'm stuck inside that fool of a fry cook.
Karen: Well,honey, you'll just have to change plans. Plug into his Eyes to See what's Going On Outside.
[Plankton unplugs SpongeBob's eye plugs]
SpongeBob: Huh? [his eyes go completely black as a bulb] Hey, Squidward, we blew a fuse!
Squidward: I'm gonna blow a fuse if you don't get that order up.
Plankton: [plugs himself with SpongeBob eye plugs, his eye glow in the dark] It worked! I can see everything SpongeBob sees.
SpongeBob: Hey, can somebody hit the lights?
Squidward: SpongeBob, where's the Krabby Patty for order 17?
SpongeBob: Oh, Squidward, is that you? Oh, it's so dark in here. I can't see a thing.
Squidward: Can you just get the Krabby Patty?
SpongeBob: Sure thing Squidward. One Krabby Patty coming up!
Plankton: Oh Boy! He's gonna make a Krabby Patty in front Of my eyes!
SpongeBob: [makes a different Krabby Patty, he uses the two pink sponges, aluminum] Oh, nuh-uh. Nuh, no. Ah, there you are, patty! Add one fluffy bun like so and a squirt of special sauce [uses the soap into the "Krabby Patty"].
Plankton: Heh, heh, special sauce. Wait, soap is the special sauce?
SpongeBob: Then you grab yourself some lettuce. [takes out strings from the mop] And voil√†! One perfect Krabby Patty! I only wish I could see how beautiful it looks. Number 17, your patty is ready. Whoa. Watch your step, Squidward. It is pitch black out here.
Squidward: Don't know, don't want to.
[he pulls a customer's face and then searches in his mouth] 
SpongeBob: Order number 17. Order number 17? Order 17? Order 17.
Plankton: That's it! I'm going somewhere else. [plugs back SpongeBob's eye plugs] Where are those ear drums? [SpongeBob's eyes turn back on]
SpongeBob: Hey, the lights are back on. [SpongeBob screams as he saw the "Krabby Patty" that he just made.] Mr. Krabs! Help me, Mr. Krabs. I've forgotten how to make Krabby Patties. Please tell me the secret recipe again.
Mr. Krabs: Need a little refresher, eh? Okay, boy. I'll run through the Krabby Patty formula one more time.
[Plankton unplugs the ear plugs, turning it to silent]
Plankton: Let me see what I can tune in here. Hmm.
Mr. Krabs: The secret of the Krabby Patty formula. Jackpot!
Plankton: Huh?
SpongeBob: I said, could you speak a little louder, please?
Mr. Krabs: The secret to the Krabby Patty formula-
SpongeBob: What?
Mr. Krabs: Hold on.
Plankton: Here it comes.
Mr. Krabs: [into a megaphone] The secret to the Krabby Patty formula is...!
Plankton: [screams as two drums come out, making Plankton becoming deaf. Plankton quickly unplugs the ear drums] Ow! I hate my life!
Mr. Krabs: Is this thing loud enough? Oh, sure, I can hear you fine now. What was the question again?
SpongeBob: Oh, it, uh-- you know, I don't remember. Me neither. So we good?
Mr Krabs: Yeah. Get out!
SpongeBob: Okay!
Plankton: Enough with these petty carnal senses. If I'm going to get the Krabby Patty recipe, I'm gonna have to go to command central. [he laughs evilly] The brain! [plugs into the brain, laughs evilly] Ugh! [he acts like SpongeBob] Hi, friend. Why am I making idiotic comments? [he gasps as he saw "Superficial Greetings" on the brain] Superficial Greetings? What kind of idiot-- [sees the parts of the brain] Personal Opinions? Knock-knock Jokes? No, no, no, no! This is all useless! I'm gonna have to go in deeper. [he gets inside the brain house] Ugh. [he was in the brain version of the living room] Where am I?
Brain Gary: Meow, meow, meow! [it slides around it]
Plankton: Ew. That's disgusting. Now, where do morons keep all their secrets? [he finds in the brain closet, searching in the squarepants, but not found] Nope. [then he finds under the brain bed in the brain bedroom] Doesn't this kid have any secrets Aha! [opens door] The library, where he keeps records of his every thought. All of his deepest, juiciest secrets. [opens the file drawer] [grunting] In convenient alphabetical order. Look at that. "Sounds that make Squidward upset"?
[he opens the file and hears SpongeBob's laughs.]
Plankton: "Patrick's favorite places to be scratched"?
Squidward: What are you doing? [SpongeBob is scratching Squidward's back]
SpongeBob: Uh, uh, scratching!
Plankton: Aagh, all of these secrets are lame! Wait a minute. What's this? [picks up a pink paper that says "Krabby Patty Recipe"] The secret recipe isn't in the brain? It's located in the heart. How cheesy. [Plankton slides down SpongeBob's spines and he lands to the heart] Ugh. Uh. [Plugs to the heart] The Krabby Patty recipe. Yes, yes, yes! Here it is! [his lips are licking] My mouth is watering. [cut to SpongeBob's tongue being cleaned] My taste buds are tingling. Mm, mm. oh, yeah. It feels so good. I can feel it all the way to my finger....stumps. All of the ingredients coming together in perfect harmony. And it's all mine! [he laughs evilly] Hwuh. Okay, that was weird. Like I was saying, the Krabby Patty recipe is...The delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab! Hwuh. Who said that?! What's happening to me? [he gasps] It's all warm and fuzzy! It's --- [Plankton's body is transforming, sponge emerges out on him] It's --- [He grows eyelashes, his eye rolled to SpongeBob, and his teeth shatters, grows buckteeth.] It's beautiful! [he laughs] All of the delicious ingredients living in perfect harmony.
Karen: You got the recipe?
Plankton: I sure did.
Karen: Well, what are you waiting for? Bring it back to the Chum Bucket.
Plankton: Karen, wouldn't that be stealing?
Karen: What? Stealing?
Plankton: The Krabby Patty recipe is the delicious sole property of the Krusty Krab.
Karen: Oh, brother. [she presses a button, Plankton is emerging out of SpongeBob's nostril]
Patrick: Hey, everybody! Wait, that's not what I wanted to say. Now, what was it?
[Plankton lands on Patrick's forehead, begins to transform, The camera shows Patrick's brain as it shrinks and pops  Plankton signs and his hand changes to a starfish, eyelashes fall, his eye roll to Patrick buckteeth shatters and grows a tooth] Huh? [he sighs, Plankton's body turn pink]
Patrick: Oh, well. Never mind. [Karen's hand opens the door, and removes Plankton from Patrick]
Karen: Well, where's the recipe?
Plankton: The What?
Karen: I knew you'd louse this up.
Plankton: Louse what up?
